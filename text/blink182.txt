Lyrics
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, when you came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone
I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah

I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in it's plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me
What went wrong (x4)

I'm kicking
Disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster

Fall comes a loaded gun
Black ties for everyone
Can you read my mind
Fall in my arms again
Grey stones that break apart
French braids demonic art
The dead come alive
Fall in my arms again (again)

I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Hold on you're breaking up

Disaster, disaster
Disaster, disaster
White stones of hollow eyes
Death comes you better hide
Never rest in town
Fall in my arms again
Full moon on a rotten night
Eighteen and a wind came by
Not a soul around
Fall in my arms again (again)

I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they won't scream loud enough
But your lips they will stutter and quaver
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up (breaking up)

I'm scared of the dark my friends
What do you fear, my love?
Your soul it will float like a dove
Your words they won't scream loud enough
But your lips they will stutter and quaver
You can't shake the taste of the blood
Hold on you're breaking up (breaking up)
Six bottles went down the drain
One hours waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time walk right on by?

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever, and after

Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep
(Fall asleep)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And after, and after, and after)

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me,
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me

Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Woo, woo
I wanna see some naked dudes
That's why I built this pool

Is that really it?
Josie, you're my
Source of most frustration
Forget when I
Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know you weren't the only one, two, three, four

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me (shit!)
 
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?

And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say, I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class, you're hating everything
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?

Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?

And she said, (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)

Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?

Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?

And she said, (na na na na na)
At the risk of sounding rude
Just who the fuck
Do you think you are
To tell me what you
Expect of me today?
Well, you can take your attitude
You're out of luck,
You've gone way too far
If you think there's any chance
I'm gonna stay

[Chorus]
How long can I string you along?
How little of myself can I give
And still make you believe I care?

At the risk of sounding trite
Why the fuck
Do you think you're right
About every little thing
That you say?

And do you think that it is right
For Tom to spend another night
Writing songs about all the people
He thinks are gay?

[Chorus: x2]
Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine I fell behind

I fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve,
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book, with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy

Who fell behind

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm still
Just a stupid, worthless boy
Are we all victims of opportunity?
locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
And saw the look of fear in my mother's eyes

Go Go Go Go
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said I'm sorry Mark but there's nowhere to stay
gave up all her hope and went back inside
hid her broken heart and let the engine die

Go Go Go Go
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Why do evil men get away with it?
can't you see that I am in a world of shit
turn your back on hope and go back inside 
stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die
Last night it came as a picture
With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
Believe me I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
This time where are you Houston
Is somebody out there will somebody listen
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you

My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much

Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you

Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you
I saw you again
I think you used me again
Should we try this before
We give up and move on
And pretend to restore
What we have and hold on

At times like these
It's obvious

I saw you again
I know you fucked him again
Can you comfort yourself
But the sense of revenge
Are you leaving me here
With the taste of the end,

At times like these
It's obvious (2x)

I saw you again and again
There's some room to move
On to move on to move on
And I saw you again and again
How do we fix this if we never had vision (repeated)
Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along

And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time

Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

(Alright)

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na 
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na 

I woke up in the pouring rain
West Side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye

Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you, you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside

And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
Sober
Sober

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)

Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Lose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice Say goodnight
As the world falls apart
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this

Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life

Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this

I'm talking to the ceiling
My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dying in this silence

The last star left in heaven
Is falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way
Do you still feel the same way

Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show

(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show 
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
Can you read my thoughts, I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and long night coming

Did you steal my prayers I don't know where I was
I feel numb and all or nothing
(All or nothing)

It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something 
To keep going

So just take my hand 
Only seconds left
The clock's running 
Our time's coming

Aaah!

It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control)

It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands

Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend
All the , small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take, one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating
Say it ain't so, I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, naÂ·
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs, surprises let me know she cares
Say it ain't so, I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, naÂ·
Say it ain't so, I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill, the night will go on, my little windmill
Say it ain't so, I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill, the night will go on, my little windmill
Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da

I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land
We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight 
But not enough to hold you back

It feels like the moon 
Is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

I love the lightning but hate the rain
Tomorrow's frightening but not today
Wish I could slow down time
But not enough to slow you down

I feel like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
The universe an empty place without you

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place

Home is such a lonely place
Uh oh
Uh oh
Oh shit
Motherfucker!
I'm gonna start dancing!

Take off your pants dad
Your penis is the biggest thing
My Butt's ever had
Because I would know
It feels good

Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker!
When I'm at work, ya,
I always rush right home for lunch
So I can check out what's up
On the Brady Bunch
And when I'm walking through
The front door at night
I gotta see who's winning
On The Price is Right, oh
I never dreamed that
I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube
Emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

What's happening in this world,
I don't care at all
But it better not preempt
Monday Night Football
I can't even come up
With my own views
I'm taught how to think
From the evening news, oh

I never dreamed that
I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube
Emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

La, la, la, la
I never found out why you left him
But this answer begs that question
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid
Left wide open
Hearts are wasted
Lives are broken

One more point of contention
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance
Bridge the border
Beg forgiveness
Round the corner
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out please shut the door

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through?
It always seemed to far to
Drive the point home
Send more letters
Pray tomorrow
Ends up better
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out please shut the door

I never did do anything that she asked
I never let what happened stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant
In spite of everything
In spite of everything
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
Do you want to know
What I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way
I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time
To fix your head
And now all alone,
One's less than two
I've never been
Better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less
Of what you say

What did you think of me
Acting this way
I guess you never
Really thought at all
Is that what you
Call your brain?
Is that why when I call
You hang up on me?

[Chorus:]
I wanted to know,
I didn't want to lose
And now I'm a man
Who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less
Of what you say

To me as I walk alone I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
To be just another
One, you are lame too

[Chorus]

To me as I tune you
Out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as
I walk alone, I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
Be just another one
You are lame too

Don't talk to me as
I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me
As I walk alone, I
Much rather be
Riding prone, man
To be just another one
You are lame too
I'm like a cat in a cage, locked up and battered and bruised
I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you

There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
With the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide,'cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
Up on the side of the field I see a city with lights
I touch her face when I kneel, she tells me she's not alive

I am too nervous to run, the kids who scatter and hide
To reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
Her world is waiting for me, a world that I rarely use
I start to feel my feet, they kick down walls as they move

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night, a fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

What's my age again?
Let’s get started, the faint and broken-hearted
Hold it up, I’ve got something I cannot hide
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes

Sad, how far you ran, I’ll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours

I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so goodnight

I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind

Sad, how far you ran, I’ll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours

I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so goodnight

I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so goodnight
There’s nothing left to say, and so goodnight
Goodnight
Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground 
As the wind does pass 
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout 

Your words are kind 
The kind that repeatedly say no 
But that's alright 
I'm older than you so I've got time 

What have you said, reach out your hand 
There's a black shadow on my wall 
But as I look into my mind 
I can see that girls are a waste of time 

We've all seen the bridge 
A broken seam and a girl on one side 
You think your words will work 
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes 

I thought of all the lines 
All the right ones used at all the wrong times 
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind 

What have you said, reach out your hand 
There's a black shadow on my wall 
But as I look into my mind 
I can see that girls are a waste of time 

I don't want to live alone 
I don't want to live in 
My broken dreams of you 
I don't want to live along with 

My broken dreams of you 
I don't want to live along with 
My broken dreams of you
I've got her in my head
At night when I go to bed
And I know it sounds lame, but
She's the girl of my dreams

And of course I'd do anything for her
I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through
The deserts of Tatooine
Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone

And even though I'm not as cool as Han
I still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of
Alderranian that I need

But when you were available, I was
Drinking Colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina
On Mos Eisley
Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone
Princess Leia
Princess Leia

Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone
In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Am I strung out, crazy, or not allowed
To be the one who gets stupid over you
Lazy (lazy), laid back (laid back), maybe you're just on crack
Why am I the one who gets fucked up and confused?
(Go!)

She doesn't care at all
She doesn't care about those times we never shared at all

If I were the last of the few who always ask
Would you still be the same person that I knew
And if it's for me, another boring story
I swear I'll act enthused
It'd be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
From your mom
(Here we go motherfuckers)
Do you want to come to a party
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party

And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard

Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard

Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chest
And the things they suggest to me

Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard
Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me and I
Won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game then
I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful
He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out everyday she goes every way, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before
I felt a stutter and a waiver, cutting like a razor
Like fire through the snow, then straight down to the bone
She creeps up like a spider, then wants you deep inside her
She turns you into stone, a twisted little show

That's how it was all to begin, cause good girls they like to sin
Way back at the starting line, when Eve was on Adam's mind
And he was the first to go, in search of the great unknown
And falling yet again, cause good girls they like to sin

You are a hero and survivor, your eyes are getting tired
There's claw marks up your spine,  it happens all the time
Those silent evil daughters, like sirens on the water
You've been the perfect crime, it happens all the time
It's Christmas Eve
And I've only wrapped two fucking presents
It's Christmas Eve
And I've only wrapped two fucking presents

And I hate hate hate your guts
I hate hate hate your guts
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your Dad'll suck me off I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mum will touch my cock, I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock, I'll never talk to you again, I'll never talk to you again

It's Labor day and my grampa just ate seven fucking hot dogs
Labor day and my grampa just ate seven fucking hot dogs

And he shit shit shit his pants
He's always fucking shit his pants
And I'll never talk to you again
Unless your Dad'll suck me off I'll never talk to you again
Unless your mum will touch my cock, I'll never talk to you again
Ejaculate into a sock, I'll never talk to you again, I'll never talk to you again
I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don't care about it
I can face your threats and
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you

You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet
Space travel's in my blood
There ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know, I can't live without it oh no

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you

Another girl, who's loving you now
Another planet, who's holding you down
Another planet
Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying, help me Jesus
We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile but not stupid
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Laws that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution sixteen's unsafe

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame

Let this train-wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown the youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules, they're fucked and boring

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame
Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror
As I drive away
Wishing that I could take back all those words
That meant nothing that I didn't say

I'm trying
To be what you want me to be
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part
Of the fool, week after week

I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)
You say you want someone to call your own
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride
You can live your life all on your own

Is this all going to be just another time
That we play this game?
I've tried to convince you that things could be different
But somehow they end up the same

But what
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost
Well, I do too

I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side
I'll just jack off in my room until then

It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one
It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one

It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one
It's never over 'til it's done
And I don't think that you're the one
Hey mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories
As if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

What if people knew that these were real
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say
What you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be till we die
I got an injection
Of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies
Alright

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you

Dark and scary, ordinary
Explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother, biofather

Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies
It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down

The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back

And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Walking through the grass
Another blade next to you from the ground
As the wind does pass
I notice as you feel the breath of my shout
Your words are kind
The kind that repeatedly say no
But that's alright
I'm older than you, so I've got time

What have you said?  
Reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

We've all seen the bridge
A broken seam and a girl on one side
You think your words will work
They only work when you lay down and close your eyes
I thought of all the lines
All the right ones used at all the wrong times
But that's alright
Depression's just a sarcastic state of mind

What have you said?  
Reach out your hand
There's a black shadow on my wall
But as I look into my mind
I can see that girls are a waste of time

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to live in
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live alone in
My broken dreams of you
I don't want to live alone in
My broken dreams of you
Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home
I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And this is what she wants
Then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above
Short of breath my long-lost love
I can't believe my eyes, are you for real?

My life before was such a mess
There's no use dwelling on the past
My broken heart was in a cast
Then you showed up and it began to heal

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel

Someday 
You'll come back to me
And I'll say 
Something bitterly

And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife, erase my vision
Take my flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel

'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel
Oh, how I wish that
They would last
Moments of peace that
Just slip through me so fast
Just when I think that
They are gonna stay
Everything inside me
Just starts fading away
Sometimes it seems
Like all I hope for
Just gets thrown
Down on the floor
And then it seems like
You don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that
I could run away
Sometimes I wish
I just had something to say

She looks at me and doesn't
Know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't
Feel quite right today
All these things I say and
Do were never planned
But how the fuck am I supposed
To make you understand that

Sometimes it seems
Like all I hope for
Just gets thrown
Down on the floor
And then it seems like
You don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that
I could run away
Sometimes I wish
I just had something to say
Lyrics
I don't want to urinate
On myself
I don't want to urinate
On anyone else
Well, I guess that really
Doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control
My bladder anymore
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)

Step back into life
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load
In my underwear

I'm sick of offending
Everyone I meet
(Go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to
Sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat,
I didn't know what to say

But, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends
(Undergarments)

Step back into life
(Go, go)
No more soiled nights alone
Well, I guess that
I don't have a care
Because there's not
A load in my underwear
Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
With the look of fear in my mothers eyes (go, go, go, go, go)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go (go, go, go)

Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said I'm sorry Mark, but there's no where to stay
Turn your back on hope and went back inside
In a broken heart and let the engine die (go, go, go, go, go)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go (go, go, go)

Why do evil men get away with it
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit
Give up all your hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
I don't wanna know (go, go)
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail

He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal

Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away

He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

Fuck this place, I lost the war
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag
Who makes up all the rules
About those girls I want?
Who tells them all to laugh?
Who tells them all
To talk about me?
And I'm not sure what
My purpose is for being here
Why do they, why do they
Always kick me in the groin
When I come near

And I'm not complaining
It just hurts after a bit

I don't know what I'm feeling
I'm just so sick of seeing
All those dumb, lame,
And retarded broads

Who often just sit kick back
As I am not so relaxed
I often wonder
Why they act so odd

Because no worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should
Make your move
It doesn't work
As you're just a jerk
With no excuse

What about that situation
All night procrastination
Taking to the point when
You lead her to her door

There is nothing left
There to say
I guess you best be
On your way
But before you go
You got to do that chore

No worse a time
When it's just your time to
Think you should
Make your move
It doesn't work
As you're just a jerk
With no excuse
Please won't you buy in
I'm always tryin'
I keep on tryin'
There's only so much pride
That I can lose

I hope that when you see me
You see right through me
Come on now, honestly
I'm so sick of endin' up
Without a clue
Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me and I
Won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game then
I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful
Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance
We've been misled
Young and hostile
But not stupid
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Mobs that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules they're f***ed and boring

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to

We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame
I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Home show, mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers, sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb

Turn low the radio
I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad posses the key
Instant slavery
No need to explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were 21

You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
To bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I hear the phone it rings so violently
Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me
I will admit I hate those things I said
Girls will always cry, guys will never admit they did

Hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you came running back
There is no use for explanation
I think these things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge
Most girls most do mean trouble, because they are rarely honest

What's with the jokes, all the routines they play
Screw with my head, never cave till they get their way
Guys like to run, chicks like to yell you see
Guys hate to fight, girls think its therapy

Hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over,
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you came running back,
There is no use for explanation
I think these things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge
Most girls most do mean trouble, because they are rarely honest

Hold on, hold on, hold on

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you came running back
There is no use for explanation
I think these things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge
Most girls most do mean trouble, because they are rarely honest

Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to this temptation
And when you came running back
There is no use for explanation
I think these things are too hopeful, even with my expert knowledge
Most girls most do mean trouble, because they are rarely honest
Don't tell me that it's over
I'm not used to temptation
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home
I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And this is what she wants
Then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
There was a time long ago
But it seemed like yesterday
When all I wanted was you

And now you make a segway
As you turn your face away
And I know your words aren't true

And I don't want your lies
And I don't think that I'm
Better than you inside

And you can take off your disguise
'Cause I can see the truth that's hidden
Behind your eyes

And all those words that you don't say
Just mean less and less each day
You can't make me shed a tear

I think about tomorrow
Another day of sorrow
But I don't think that I'll be here
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, when you came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone
Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because

And my girlfriend likes ul and dhc
And she's so smart and independent
I dont think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place

And I know that everything's gonna be fine

Yeah my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because

And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place

And I know that everything's gonna be fine
Do you wanna know what I think of you?
'Cause you're not the way I thought you should be
Do take back what you said
It's time to fix, it's time to fix your head

And now all alone, one's less than two
I've never been better off living lonely
To listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

What did you think of me acting this way
I guess you never really thought at all
Is that what you call your brain?
Is that why I call you hang up on me?

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
And now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I walk alone I
Much rather be riding prone, man
To be just another one you are lame to

I wanted to know, I didn't want to lose
But now I'm a man who's just living small
Listen to what you say
I couldn't care less of what you say

To me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I
Much rather be riding prone, man
Be just another one you are lame to

Don't talk to me as I tune you out of my mind
Won't bend over backwards or
Take another step there to
Hear from you again

Don't talk to me as I walk alone, I
Much rather be riding prone, man
To be just another one you are lame to
Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time, but a little worse, and

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass."

One more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass."

Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, don't let my door hit your ass

Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine
There she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes
And a heart of steel always on her own
Almost never real
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love
And she was like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road clears day of life
Always sharp and cold always beautiful
I am such a fool

When the night will begin
The pain won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love

Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
Driving you mad even if she falls in love
(No we ain't gonna take it
Unless it's from a Doberman pincher
Ladies and gentlemen
For your listening pleasure, Blink)

Passively one day as the sun
Rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as
He whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance

He fell in love so quickly
What the Hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm
Wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought
That he once met
I guess you could only blame fate

Things started getting weird
As they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and
Remembered how
Her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song that's been
Deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and

She knew at that one moment
That song was something
She heard before
So she asked him to do that again

Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end

She said, "When I was a little girl
My Dad left my mom
He used to always fart and
Sing this special song
Now I wasn't quite so sure
Until your pants did fall
'Cause now I know that
You're my dad because
You use ben wah balls"

I said a
You don't need nothin'
And I know that you won't even try
Don't wait for me to help you
Too late for any of my advice

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright
Misplaced your values
Forgot the importance of being right
Don't sit there and act humble
I've heard your story a thousand times

No trust
All I got is lies
Boring
Alright
It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her

But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
Day in day out
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Whoa
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth

In Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home 
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming)

Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home

Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends

Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
One more time you will laugh about it
And he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care, he is such a dick
Treats you like you are a stupid whore

And it seems like things will never change
You go on, every cloud is in your way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

Why leave when you claim it is love?
But why stay when you're not the only one?
She's proved she's strong
Be brave, be strong

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (because she fell right off her bed)
She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor (because she fell right off her bed)
Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for

You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor

I'm a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole)

Oh, oh 
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Crossed the street
Naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
Now in prison for one month no one to see
All I got is this guy Ben Dover

Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs

Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my shit
The farmer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came and took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay

Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude-I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs
(I miss you miss you)

Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

(I miss you I miss you)
(I miss you I miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

I miss you (miss you miss you)
(I miss you miss you)
And when the day ends I'm sure she feels sorrow
The lonely guy I am, I wait for her change
I've been here two days, I'll sure be here tomorrow
I'd eat her out if she were on my dinner plate

[Chorus]
(And I wish)
I wish she'd be more kind now
I'm out of luck 'cause the shades are pulled down
I've seen everything there is to be shown
I followed her all the way home

I can't be too cool in a tree with my pants down
The air is cold and I've got splinters in my feet
She caught me once, but I don't think that she cares now
Unlike before, her view is now blocked by a leaf

[Chorus]

I bet this last time's the one time too many 
The rush of waiting is burning through my head 
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week 
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred 

I've made mistakes by looking in the wrong window
Her dad is big and I've never seen his face
I've been here two days, and I'll sure be here tomorrow
My lady's so sweet, she likes to entertain

[Chorus]

I bet this last time's the one time too many 
The rush of waiting is burning through my head 
Right after supper her brother shower's twice a week 
He kicks my ass so much, that filthy white inbred 

(1, 2, 3, 4)
Shut the fuck up she said
I'm going fucking deaf
You're always too loud
Everything's too loud

Now that all my friends left
This place is fucking dead
I want to move out
When can we move out
This shit has got to stop
I'll run away

Get the fuck up she said
Your life is meaningless
It's going nowhere
You're going nowhere

You're just a fuck up she said
I'll live alone instead
She said "you don't care"
I know I don't care

I'll never ask permission from you
Fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home

I got too fucked up again
And passed out on the plane
Tried to forget you
I can't forget you

No sleep on this flight
I'll think about the nights
We had to get through
How did we get through?

I'll never ask permission from you
Fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home
I'll run away

I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave
I think it's time that I should leave

I'll never ask permission from you
Fuck off I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home
I'll run away

I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I think it's time for me to leave (I'll run away)
I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room
Listening to all the doubts that your parents have to say to you

And as your head gets all cluttered inside
Try to stay awake
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggressions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say as
They tell you what to be you're not alone

I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do
It's not the same reason why that
Makes you change the things that you once knew

As your head gets all cluttered inside
Give more than you take
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggressions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say as
They tell you what to be you're not alone

You say you want to take off your shoes and
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week, go!

You say you want to take off your shoes just to
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week

So hold in all your aggressions
Because your grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin

It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say as
They tell you what to be you're not alone
(Get ready for action!)
I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Fuck it it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met

Look to the past
And remember her smile
And maybe tonight
I can breathe for a while
I'm not in the seat
I think I'm fallin' asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head

Is it back again?
Are you back again?

Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh)

What's the point of saying sorry now
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out)

What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now)
Woo! Come on!
Woo!

[Repeats]
Just about done with it but we'll let you know
Hey
We work and slave the day away
We're wasting perfect families
We fucking fight like vagabonds
We dance like fucking animals

Don't stop the band is coming on
Rude boys and punks will shout a lot
Police cars bring cuffs and loaded guns
Kids scream but laughing as they run

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home

Gunshots the punks are rioting
The stage is slowly crumbling
Smash doors and try to stay alive
A few drinks and you look of broken light

They'll hide and call the cavalry
Let's dance in perfect harmony
Get close the crowd will come apart
That girl will try to make you hard

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o do you wanna
This time I-I-I, I-I-I, I hope you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I hope, do you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o, do you wanna
This time I-I-I, I-I-I, I hope you wanna
Let go o-o-o, o-o-o 'cause this is home
Mom and dad they quite don't understand it
All the kids they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose?
And walk around in torn pantyhose, oh yeah

I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
I like the the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Hate the jocks, the preps, the hippie fuckin' scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hair bands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in

Give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to and don't fit in
I know I'm pathetic I knew when she said it
A loser a bum's what she called me when I drove her home
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
I've done all I can but she still wants to be left alone
You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue 
No one, no one, no one likes a drop-out
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down this is where I belong 
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong

I think it's disgusting believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing It's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move

Don't pull me down this is where I belong 
I think I'm different but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down this is where I belong
I think I'm different, this is where I belong
Eyes are, open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight

Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)

Left alone 
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones 
Fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder

(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
They question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline

I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego)

Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)
Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego)

I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow 
To the ocean blue

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego)
There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

(Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
(Oh oh oh oh) but all my friends are daring me to come over
(Oh oh oh oh) so I come over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) so let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
(Oh oh oh oh) that I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh life is too short to last long)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Stop banging away on my kaleidoscope
Stop draining the color out of my scene
Just play me something I can dance to
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

So lock me up in a studio,
Fill it up with sound and scenarios
Stop blocking the driveway with your car
Put the butterfly in the bill jar

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road

Your dangers forcing the front yard
Many hours tick past the deadline
Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine

To leave the progress on your game
Try to fall asleep while your ears ring
From the loudest songs on your mix tape
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

No reason, no action,
No silence, no help here,
Nobody came running up by my side

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night
It's a long road to get it right

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's the first time, that I worried
Of a bad dream, of a journey
On a highway through the valley
It's a long road through the night

It's a long road

To get it right
To get to get to get it right
To get to get it right
To get it right
A freight train to the right, feeling that sting of pride
It's fucking with me, it's fucking with you
All's fair in love and war until you say it isn't but you're wrong
Words on the back of flyers, my clothes are in the dryer
It means nothing, nothing is changing
La familia is dead and gone, the children grew up and moved on

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Prime select and a box of glazed, pulling fly-bys on days
When we were young and innocent
Elbow-drop Sundays when Mark Eaton got beat to shit

Laughing at the bands we hate, all the spots we used to skate
They're still there, but we've gone our own ways
I know it's for the best but sometimes I wonder 
Will I ever have friends like you again?

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

Is it too much to ask for the things to work out this time?
I'm only asking for what is mine
I wanted everything, I got it and now I'm gonna
Throw it away, I'll throw it away (yeah)

You're gonna drown in the mess you make
Your self-inflicted hate
You turn your back on the friends you lose
When they don't follow all your rules

But people are what they wanna be
They're not lemmings to the sea
Maybe it's time you looked at yourself
And stop blaming life on someone else
13 miles down the road lives a young boy
He's got jet black hair and blue-green eyes
And he's mine
And every now and then, he and I
Would sit together on the porch
And I take off his pants
And I fuck him from behind

And I love him for his heart and soul
And I love his wrinkled scrotum too
So if you see us passing by
On some dreary rainy day
Take a look at the young boy
And his naked asshole
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again?

What's my age again?
When I'm at work, ya, I always rush right home for lunch
So I can check out what's up on the Brady Bunch
And when I'm walking through the front door at night
I gotta see who's winning on The Price is Right, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

What's happening in this world, I don't care at all
But it better not preempt Monday Night Football
I can't even come up with my own views
I'm taught how to think from the evening news, oh

I never dreamed that I'd spend my days
Staring at some tube emitting cathode rays
I need my TV

La la la
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel

Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
(I had sex with your mother) night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
Night alone
Thanks a lot you guys!
Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to
The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see
You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth
I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck
And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that
Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later!

Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony
Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from
All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah?
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on

I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large

Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo

He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog brownie drugs
Tried hard not to get caught
He fucked a chick in the parking lot

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large
Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friend's mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large
Take off the gloves
We fell in love by the side of the road
This desert will break you down
The veins you cut
Your smoking tongue is the end of us all
But you only care about
Fame and fortune
Watching others tortured
Casting your reflection
Grocery store perfection
This is the last time
Sent to the front line
With dirty boots on the ground
You said I'll make this all mine

You seemed so sweet at the start
But the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart
But your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone

Blackjack and architect
Let's drink ourselves to death
The crimes of everyone
Passed down from father to son
Hopeless and destitute
Destroyed by gratitude
Your strongest lines of defense
Are all just self-inflicted wounds

You seemed so sweet at the start
But the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart
But your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start
But the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart
But your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start
But the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart
But your heart's all gone

You seemed so sweet at the start
But the start's all wrong
You say you speak from your heart
But your heart's all gone
Yeah your heart's all gone
Breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here
Act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can I please go home now?

I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And there I stayed

Lay beside me
And listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes

I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise
That I will never tell
All I remember is
The way her bedroom smelled

I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time
Goodnight, goodnight
Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Lose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice 
Say goodnight as the world falls apart
Fuck I can't let this kill me
Let go
I need some more time to fix this
Here's a letter for you but the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past 
Talk some shit, take it back
Are we cursed to this life?
I'm talking to the ceiling
My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dying in this silence
The last star left in heaven 
Is falling down to earth and...
Do you still feel the same way?
Do you still feel the same way?
This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing)

I'm so lost
I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself
But words escape me
It's too late
To save me
You're too late
You're too late

You're cold with disappointment
While I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension
I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me

This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing)
Never found out why you left him,
but this answer begs that question,
Too blind to see tomorrow,
too broke to beg or borrow.
Young and Stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken

One more point of contention, 
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
betray my short attention span
The distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness, round the corner
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you,
a few more months to argue
Is this to much to live through,
it always seems to far to drive
The point home, send more letters
Pray tomorrow, ends up better
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out, please shut the door

I never did do anything that she asked, 
I never let what happened, stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant,
In spite of everything, in spite of everything
Everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
but everytime I look for you the sun goes down
My mind wanders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you
'Cause every time I awake I ponder on my mistakes of
What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you

I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door
I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you
But now you won't talk to me for something that I didn't do

It's not gonna work

And I'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide
I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah

I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in its plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes

I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
What went wrong

I'm kicking
[Tom]
I want to fuck a dog in the ass

[Mark]
He wants to fuck a dog in the ass

[Tom]
I wanna fuck a dog
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass
Tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog....and his ass

[Mark and Tom]
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass
We wanna fuck a dog

[Tom]
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass

[Mark]
Aargh me and me first mate asurvy cur

[Tom]
Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I've found the dog

[Mark, in Mexican accent]
Ah that was no pirate man that was thine own sister

[Mark]
It's a Mexican pirate

[Mark and Tom]
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
We want to fuck a dog in the ass
Wanna fuck a fucking dog

[Mark]
Fuck you
I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling
These broken nights and bitter ends
We would always starve and devour
Our closest friends my beautiful friends
Paranoia my paranoia
Can’t let it go, it never lets me go
What am I feeling, why am I feeling
Forecast into the freezing cold

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I’m the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
‘Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony cries

Your only hope is burning down the chapel
All getting washed out with the tide
We need to find some middle ground
It’s always sex or suicide

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I’m the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
‘Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony cries

Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs
Dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs, dogs eating dogs

I’m the last and the first in a very sad set of eyes
To the bone, to the knees, to the factory line
I am numb to the shot, I have a crippling fear of heights
‘Cause the fall sounds a lot like a symphony cries
I woke up today
Surrounded by blackness
A small warning sign
Devoured the process
It’s always been fine
I get up and ignore this
And it’s hard to say
But I feel all of this weightless
But the more that I admit
I feel up and anxious
And the more I go on
The less I can face this
And those rotten things
That live in our shadow
We walk on the line
Of death and the gallows
And hope that we’re clear
I bet we can follow

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

When I was young
The world it was smaller
The cities were vast
The buildings were taller
I felt really strong
My parents seem stronger
My life has a way
Showers with greatness
Then takes it away
Those pieces that made us
The dangerous things
You’d never imagine
We all get the same
The memories that burn
And those pictures we made
They still form a pattern
They courteously say
Does it not matter?

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright (doesn’t hurt that much)

It’s the worst damn day (doesn’t hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn’t hurt that much)
But I’m alright
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face

You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone

Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah later, see you around
Outside the carolers start to sing 
I can't descibe the joy they bring 
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me 

My girlfriend is by my side 
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice 
Their whiny voices get irritating 
It's Christmas time again 

So I stand with a dead smile on my face 
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste 
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers

And then I guess I must have snapped
Because I grabbed the baseball bat 
And made them all run for shelter

It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand 
All year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't wanna get beat down 
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve 
'Cause the cops came and arrested me 
They had an unfair advantage 
And even though the jail didn't have a tree 
Christmas came a night early 
'Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package

It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand 
All year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't wanna get beat down 
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas 
Down, down, down,
Pick me up I'm falling
Down, down, down,
Pick me up I'm falling
Down, down, down,
Pick me up I'm falling
Down, down, down,
Pick me up I'm falling
I can almost see your house from here
But the signal seems to disappear so what's the problem?
Houston's calling
Then you hit me like a Friday night
Like a handgun in a firefight
Dive in slow motion towards the ocean

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm kind of nervous of the consequence
As we climb over the neighbor's fence the longest summer's nights are numbered
Then you kissed me like a storm at sea
Like I'm the only one you'll ever need
We're left abandoned in the deep end

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

(We're teenage satellites)

We are a slow descent
Forgotten astronauts
We are an avalanche
We're just an afterthought

Let's run away, let's go and waste another year
Let's spin apart while racing through the atmosphere

We tumble through the night, we burn so bright
We're teenage satellites

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (we're teenage satellites)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (teenage satellites)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (teenage satellites)
With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you

Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know

With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you

Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know

She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you

Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know

She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you

And all again I wait for this
To fill a whole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you
Come here, please hold my hand for now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how to fight this
God has a master plan and I guess
I am in His demand
Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see you when this is done
And now I have come to realize
That you are the one who's left behind
Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on
To me I'm right here waiting

I see, a light it feels good
And I'll come back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on
To me I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting
Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on
To me I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting
Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here hold on
To me I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting
The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
(this can't be the end)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
(You did this)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do

Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again
Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one

It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again
Hanging out behind the club
On the weekend
Acting stupid getting drunk
With my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer
And the Warped Tour
I remember it's first time
That I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school
'Cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous 'cause
I think all her friends hate me
She's the one,
She'll always be there
She took my hand and
I made it, I swear

I fell in love in with the girl
At the rock show
She said, 'What'?
And I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool
When I'd sneak her
Through the window
Everything's better
When she's around
Can't wait till her
Parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl
At the rock show

When we said we were
Gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look
Her mother gave us
Seventeen without
A purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone
A fucking explanation

I fell in love in with the girl
At the rock show
She said, "What?"
And I told her that
I didn't know
She's so cool
When I'd sneak her
Through the window
Everything's better
When she's around
Can't wait till her
Parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl
At the rock show

I kept my picture of her
On my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love in with the girl
At the rock show
She said, "What?"
And I told her that
I didn't know
She's so cool
When I'd sneak her
Through the window
Everything's better
When she's around
Can't wait till her
Parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl
At the rock show

With the girl
At the rock show
With the girl
At the rock show

I'll never forget you, I'll
(With the girl
At the rock show)
I'll never forget you, I'll
(With the girl
At the rock show)
(Repeat to fade)
(I miss you miss you)

Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

(I miss you I miss you)
(I miss you I miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

I miss you (miss you miss you) 
(I miss you miss you)
Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don't know
Here's a form, go wait in line
Can't you see I'm doing fine, it's what I've always wanted

Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love, now it's gone
Good things haven't happened yet
I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted

Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California
Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I've seen in magazines
Let's take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear, iIt's what I've always wanted

Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California

Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh) 

Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California
So sorry, it's over
so sorry, it's over
there's so much more that I wanted and (so sorry, it's over)
there's so much more that I needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry, it's over)
soon we'll all be gone

Let's take some time to talk this over
you're outta line and rarely sober
we can't depend, on your excuses
because in the end it's fucking useless
you can only lean, on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin' out on a ledge, begged you to come down
you can only lean, on me for so long

I remember shots without a chaser
absent minded thoughts now you're a stranger
cover up the scars, put on your game face
left you in a bar, to try and save face
you can only lean, on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin' out on a ledge, begged you to come down
you can only lean, on me for so long

So sorry, it's over
so sorry, it's over
there's so much more that I wanted and (so sorry, it's over)
there's so much more that I needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry, it's over)
soon we'll all be gone

Man on a mission
can't say I miss him around
insider information
hand in your resignation
loss of a good friend
best of intentions I found
tight lipped procrastination
ya, later... see you around 
All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill
When you talk about tomorrow
I'm not sure about today
When you tell me
That you love me
What am I supposed to say?
Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

Words like forever
They scare the shit out of me
Maybe I'm afraid
Of commitment
Maybe you're too
Distracted to see that

Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel

I think of all the things
I'd say to you
If I had the chance again
I think of all the things
I'd scream
But I think it's for the best
That you and I just
Don't connect and
Things are never quite
What they seem

Will there ever be
Someone to give
Her heart to me
Or would I be
To blind to see it

I wouldn't make a sound
I'd keep it underground

It always seems like
I'm running around around
Running around around
Round
Sometimes I don't feel
The same way as you feel
I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy

Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
For real 'cause you were driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy

I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
'Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving

The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed

It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring

Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

And she said, "It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again

We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's burning at both ends."

And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move

I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool

I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone

I know just where I stand, a boy
Trapped in the body of a man and

I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in

She's so important
And I'm so retarded

And now I realize
I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway
Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?

And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me

You know that it meant everything to me
She said "Tonight's a waste of time"
The next day, the sun will always rise
Every day that you waste, every promise you break
Slips beneath the floor
It's a permanent state from a moments mistake
But life's worth so much more

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

She said that it's too late to try
Someday, I'll smile and say goodbye
Every night that you fight, every demon in sight
Sleeping on the floor
Wide awake from the dream with a shake and a scream
Hope for so much more

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you

Where did she go?
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go? (Did she go, did she go?)
And what did she hope to find there?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find it?
Where did she go, did she go, did she go?
Where did she go to find it?

You don't know a thing about it
Hours lost to dawn from dusk
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)
Let the music seal your fate
Yeah, you can run but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future)

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
They don't care about you
When the clock strikes two,
There's just so much to do
And I can't explain what I need
Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping our reputations clean
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Again
The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
Not that I'm poor, just to fine
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Oh no, it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours it's so
You leave me nowhere to go

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Buy hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart
(Be strong when things fall apart)
Honest, this breaks my heart
(It's so hard)
Lets go!

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
I've had it with this damn double vision
My hand's swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it, I can't, can't brush it off

Love, love is dangerous
Love, love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, just like my television
It's still sharp and her words cut through the clouds

Love, love is dangerous (just don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one's we've ever care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous

(I need)
Love, love is dangerous (just don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one's we've ever care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous
He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out everyday she goes every way, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before
All her signals are getting lost in the ether, she's a landslide like a city beneath her
So take a good look, so you'll never forget it (That's what she wanted)
Take a deep breath, I know I'm gonna regret it (That's what she wanted)

Holly's looking dry looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster

She's got a mission, and I'm collateral damage (That's what she wanted)
She's the flower that you place on my casket (That's what she wanted)
Savor the moment cause the memory's fleeting
Take a photograph, as the last train is leaving
Holly's looking dry looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger
Southern California's breeding mommy's little monster
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run (Holly let me out)
Better run run run run run run run (Holly let me out)
I'm wasting time
Thinking about a girl
And stealing her away
From her world
She and I would run away
I think of all the things that I'd say
We'd talk about important things
And I picture it in my dreams
She'd teach me
About modern art
And I'd show her
It's OK to fart and

Maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and
Wondering if I'm
Sitting at home,
Thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Remembering how
She laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remembering the look
She gave me
When I told her that
I used to fly

I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar
Would never make it

And in my town
You can't drive naked

And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and
Wondering if I'm
Sitting at home,
Thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time
Thinking about a girl
Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

The three-date theory is getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I'll be moving on, moving on
Moving on, and on and on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on and on and on

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
(This can't be the end)

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad

Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so

Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
(You did this)

Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.

Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Coming in, coming in, kill the radio silence
Break down in L.A.
Giving up, giving in, to a feeling of violence
There's hell to pay

So, let's light another match, stop living in the past
Where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage, watch the children come of age
When their parents stop to take a bow

Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Nothing takes root in this barren soil
Maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong, when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Line em' up, on the wall, coming out with their hands up
Give em' all the chair
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the world come
Who's left to care?

Nothing tastes takes root in this barren soil
Nothing tastes root but the pain and toil
Maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for the hired guns
Hold strong, when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong, when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Stop living in the shadow of a helicopter
Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again

Just yesterday it always seemed like such a dream
We're unstoppable, indestructible, nothing happens to our machine
And there's no harm at least nothing we can see
As for you not so true you couldn't choose where his road would lead

What a loss you just lost all your sleep
And we've always thought that this could never happen you see
That it's so hard you gotta get up on your feet
Cause the only way I gotta say is to move on through the week

Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again

I'm sorry (What's happened to you?)

Don't bide your time cause it is almost over
I know your down and I'll see you around
And I know it hurts but your just getting older
I know you'll win you'll do it once again
(I miss you, I miss you)
Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want 
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted 
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already 
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already 
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

(I miss you, I miss you) 
(I miss you, I miss you) 
(I miss you, I miss you) 
(I miss you, I miss you)
I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for

She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream 
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
And threw herself on the floor

She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)

Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show [Repeats]
Six bottles went down the drain 
One hours a waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by
Like violence you have me forever
And after
Like violence you kill me forever 
And after
Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still as you fall asleep
Fall asleep
Like violence you have me forever 
And after
Like violence you kill me
Like violence you kill me
It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her

But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now

Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This make no,

This air is too thick to breath so just drive,
these eyes are too sick too see, go leave me behind
something swimming in my blood, somethings rotting in my brain
I'm smothered from the flood, I can't recognize you face,
I need to leave so just drive,

Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last time
I'm always fighting the gravity
Tonight is too much fro me to get through,
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room,
When I'm far away from you.

Burning lights on the street, fight fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
I'm getting lost in a dream, yes, this is the last time
I'm always fighting the gravity
I'm always fighting the gravity

This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This makes no sense
This make no
I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow

But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side

But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over
(ahh...)

What? It'll clear up, I promise, I got some ointment for it,
The doctor says it's not infectious it'll be gone in a week.
My dearest

I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together
And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come
I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately

I've read your letter through at least four times
And will probably read it more times before I'm through

I've been sitting here, looking at your picture
And getting more homesick every minute
I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of
Except of course, you yourself

I keep thinking of you darling
Keep wishing I could be home with you
I want to leave in the worse possible way so I can come home to see you
But, things don't look so good in that subject

This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now
I'm completely lost without you darling
I never realized I could even miss any one person so much

I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again
And live a sane and normal life
I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home)

Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always

And I'll miss your laugh your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights I hate them
Lets start this again for real

So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
Touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying

Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
Touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
Remember the days
We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?"

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
A I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long

You have your other friends
They were there
When you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't
Leave your side

But what do I get

And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long

It's not a change of pace

It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night

When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then

So sorry, it's over
(Ah)
I could never own up, I need to speak up
I don't want to grow up, don't want to end up
Caught in a landslide with the other side
Living for the paycheck, dying for the weekend
Take another Xanax, cheating on your girlfriend
Taking your last breath, counting down the time

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

They said I'd never make it (Watching me fall)
All the time I wasted (Learning to crawl)
Crawl from the ashes as this world comes crashing down

Don't tell me it's too late, I'm stuck at heaven's gate
Strike a match and start a wildfire
I'll own all my mistakes, won't give you what you take
Watch you burning in the wildfire

We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all (The underdogs came home)
We won this war, we cursed and swore
They stood no chance at all

I don't forget, I don't forgive
I'll never change the way I live
I always fought the urge to fall in line
I turned my back on all the rules
I'll never heed the king of fools
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life

I don't forget, I don't forgive (We won this war)
I'll never change the way I live (We cursed and swore)
I always fought the urge to fall in line (They stood no chance at all)
I turned my back on all the rules (We won this war)
I'll never heed the king of fools (We cursed and swore)
I'll never lead the perfect kind of life (They stood no chance at all)

The underdogs came home
I'll never let you down boy
I'll never let you go
Her solace of life
Is so innocent and scary

So tell me that you're here boy
She says as if she knows
When God took her with time
God made me quite alone

It's like the universe has left me
Without a place to go
Without a hint of light
To watch the movement glow

Where a song is slowly starting
Your memory felt so real
At first against my will
But God invented chills

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight
The moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine
My wounds would start to heal

The kids are in a hurry
And I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry
It's getting hard enough to hear

It's like the evidence is cared for
And evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor
I'll never leave you here

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight
The moment it felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine
My wounds would start to heal

I felt your ghost tonight
And I felt like hell
To know you're almost mine
But dreams are all I feel

I, I saw your ghost tonight
It fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight
But dreams can't all be real

I saw your ghost tonight
It fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight
But dreams can't all be real
Come here, please hold my hand LORD now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how
To fight this, God has a master plan
And I guess, I am in his demand
Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see, you when this is done
And now I, have come to realize 
That you are, the one who's left behind
Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting

I see, the light it feels good
And I'll come, back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting [Repeat: x3]
There's something about you
That I can't quite put my finger in
I saw you again
I think you used me again
Should we try this before we give up and move on
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
At times like these
It's obvious
I saw you again
I know you fucked him again
Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end

At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision

I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision
I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back
To what I had
Don't want to spend
My life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around
Being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings
I would do anything and that's
What scares me so bad
Don't want to live my life alone
Don't want to go back
To what I had

Don't want to spend
My life without
All those special things
Don't want to walk around
Being tied to
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings
Strings, strings, strings, strings
