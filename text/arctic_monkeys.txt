Lyrics
Anything we should know about your change? -- Oh and the cost to correct a fraud
A fraud
I'm going to go out and kid them
Applaud
Applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours

You figure out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette
We think out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette

And if you found this it's probably too late
Clinically cynical hereditary hate
If you found this it's probably too late
Ever so clinical I'm running out of mates

If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready but probably rough
Frightening honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff
When I got back from fixing my hair,
You were directing traffic.
Letting your story slip on the snow as
If the transmission was automatic.
It's arguable
That I shouldn't have been there.
It was fortunate timing.
I had a hole in the pocket
Of my favorite coat
And my love dropped
Into the lining.
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me. I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
You can't sleep
Until you've sat
On the steps to weep
Until you feel like
You've wept yeah.
(As long as you don't forget your strange)
(Have you got your strange?)
No, not on me. I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange.
I haven't got my strange.
So who's that girl there? 
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
He told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down

And oh he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around, here

And look here comes a ford mondeo
Isn't he mister inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
And don't stop in the winter no and

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
And then he know his people wept
When you crafted your plan

Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game

This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

Is he really on the street?
Desperation or deceit?
And what he's wearing on his feet
Won't solve our mystery

And I am baffled by
How you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity
Where you hide your grin? Better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes
Everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game

This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, your conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
Lying again, conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

Fools on parade cavort and carry on 
For waiting eyes 
That you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 

She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here 
It's a magnolia celebration 

To be attempted on a Wednesday night 
It's better than to get a reputation 
As a miserable little tyke 
At least that's the conclusion 
She came to in this overture 

The secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing 
She's just giggling along 

Her arms were folded most indignant 
Not looking like she was soon to leave 
I had to squint in order to believe 
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 

I'm unveiling the unexpected 
How she was never gonna look to? 
Suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat 

The secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing 
She's just giggling along 
And even if they were to find us 
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied 

At all the fools on parade
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes 
That you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind 

To be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade
Frolic and fuck about to make her gaze 
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture 

That holds her options 
But you're daft to think she'd care 

Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along
Old yellow bricks
Love's a risk
Quite the little 'escapologist'
Looked so miffed
When you wished
For a thousand places better than this

You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

She was enraged but the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she been dull
Lead to nights readin' beer bottles

You're such a fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss
Just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was

You are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
Dorothy was right though
We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
But this lad at her side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting
'Bout who were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
They said "no surrender
No chance of retreat"

And so why are they in the taxi?
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

Drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, "Are you sure?"
Went for it but the red light was showing
And red light indicates doors are secured
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Yeah they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh

You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright
Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

A country home, even if we really tried
Would it cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back d'ya know?

Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well, spoken girls and stilettos
Aren't something to fear

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore
Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore
Cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
As well as you think
And you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets 'n'
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!
You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And oh the curtain leads to fever

We watched a womaniser cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Can feign excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merriment
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

And the tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

The days drag their heels when you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brass

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing
Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shuttered doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

You can itch, flap, and whistle
And try to avoid the talk
As I scribbled over drivel you were snoring, showing off

The tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast
Tricking through the morning, 
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm, 
Shifts past your whiskers, 
So spark is a charm with the barking alarm, 
Weighs coil 'til the corner is turned. 

And the bicycle wheels, all struggle to move round, 
In your muddy mind, 
Blatantly cape town, 
And will intertwine in co-operative time, 
Shall we sit on the springs 'til the mung goes dry? 

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first the chicken or the dickhead? 
Split sleep reeps through rewards and ill fitting thoughts, 
A twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk, 
Your legs start running and your head gets caught, 
Cannot be nineteen, it's perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening, 
Pulled from the after taste, you'll have to slip away, 
And I'm happy to say, 
Behold as the crook in a hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold as the crook in the hammock plays, 
Crawling with the base of the scales, 
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
Gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
Trailing wrapped in a gasp, 

Crawling with the base of the scales, 
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
You were gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
Trailing wrapped in a gasp. 

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.
Open Sesame. (We've places to go)
We've people to see. (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make
When you want to escape say the word

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Eyes the colour of, (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust. (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you.
If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller
Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings in the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just in case

And now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Is it true you win when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
Do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

And now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away a laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle
Baby, I'm yours
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky,
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines,
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world can drive me away
Cause every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three,
Yours (yours) until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Till the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Till the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Well, this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said they're always exciting words to hear

They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now

They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin
What it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had to

And how can you wake up
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly phased by it
Oh, he had a struggle

They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now

Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer? 
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks
Never again
Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
Been fighting with my sheets
And nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well taught gripe
The most restraining type
You should have racing stripes

The way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot
And you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I won't be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through
The thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And cause the audience

The frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam
She broke everyone's hearts

I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess lioness
Pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
The mirror's image
It tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side

And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner
Well are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
(Message you reply)
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

And I can't see you here when I'm high
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found all I was hoping to find
You said you got to be up in the morning
Gonna have an early night
And you starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Caricatures of your wrecking ball 
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lining up 
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
Hiding has changed its tune 
Linking arms, syncing hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
His way or no way, he totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away
We'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things
That I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday, of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away
We'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things
That I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore
I said, last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore, oh

Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Lady where's your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
?No chance, you'll get nothing from me?
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
And he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Lady where's your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And now realizing it won't change a thing
Realizing it won't change a thing
He sank into their calculations
And snorted on the stench
Of their arithmetic.
Looked for the boy who was hanging his head low,
More trophies than ideas. To follow their pretence.

With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obidience
And fell in the Nettles.

Afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope.
And skipped the bits they loathed.
Didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
To advice his mind had closed
He lost all of his footholes.

He was a toothpick!
And the garlic and the cinder upon the path
Had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
Clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
Off to a reminder of where he had been.

With a smile in his pocket
And a scowl on his face
He had nowhere to flee
So sat content in the Nettles.
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking a Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

Oh, that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now, when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

Oh, that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory, and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again
Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Started all the naughty nights with niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Everything was pretty in the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?
We all want some one to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been, where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia
Everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Just because we're having a say so
Not lining up to be Play-Doh
In five years time will it be
Who the fuck's arctic monkeys?

'Cause everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that I just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue

It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape, yeah?
I thought I saw you in the battleship
But it was only a look a like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in the rusty hook
Huddled up in wicker chair
I wandered up for a closer look
And kissed who ever was sitting there

She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely, please
Can I call you her name

And I elongated my lift home,
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the parrots beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm

It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in letraset
No you can't call me her name

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way 'round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I saw your sister in the cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand

She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,
You can call me anything you want
Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling, I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said, you don't know nothing

Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh and you say you have forgotten but you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

Oh-woah, woah, woah
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Oh-woah, woah, woah

Oh, so what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said, what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing

I fancy you with a passion
Oh, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar, too
But you're a fad and you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright, yeah, I'll put it on one side
Oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes including mine
Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip and fryer fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don’t sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well-known hard man
And start a fight
Weigh your chances on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah

Bite the lightning
But tell me how it tastes
Kung-fu fighting
On your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don’t sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Brian
Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful, so strangely comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours

She'll be saying, use me
Show me the jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there, on a plate
You're whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire the eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
Hup

Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their
Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said your mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never look like yourself from the side
But your profile did not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying
I want to build you up (brick by brick)
I want to break you down (brick by brick)
I'm going to reconstruct (brick by brick)
I want to feel you love

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)

I want to steal your soul (brick by brick)
I want to rock 'n' roll (brick by brick)
I want to rock and roll (brick by brick)
I want to rock and roll

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)

I want a brick by brick (brick by brick)
I wanna blow wide berth (brick by brick)
I wanna melt this soul (brick by brick)
I wanna brick by brick, by brick, by

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)
He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
Three quarters of an hour ago
That led him to be in a position
And every copper mission
On every other episode

He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on

You should know you're his favorite worst nightmare
Well, the morning was complete
Where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end 
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that
It's these times that it tends
To start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your heart

And do me a favor, will you break my nose
And do me a favor, and tell me to go away
Oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

Well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
When the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried 
And I watched, and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

And do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
She said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind
Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
And violently you swung, through unfamiliar tongue
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

When I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at.
Now then Mardy Bum
I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare

Can't we laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs ,oh when you say I don't care
Well of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
Been trying to think of something colorful for this season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all I have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

I thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain's trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots, I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

Those people make me calm, calm the flame
Come up to the moth for a change
Darling if it's all the same to you, I'll have you to myself
I'm joining the dots, I'm joining the dots
If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no thank-yous, and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rock the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches?
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying be the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known, then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears, then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give
Well the times are so a'changing
Baby even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind

You knew it would go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh there's nothing you can't find

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you

As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah) Yeah

So baby take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Knee socks
Knee socks
Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a helter skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a seventies head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
Topless models
Doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by
And get ignored
Illuminations
On a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing
A reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses
Where teeth collide
When she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens
With a shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

I left my message but did he forget back to me
And now I'm stuck here wondering
How it's meant to be

Singing a reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen

I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that is said is that you've drank a lot

And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind yeah
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out
For a reason it would block
Oh you send her after nine o' clock
Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that is said is that you've drank a lot

And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind yeah
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out
Around three o' clock
When the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
A moment more
And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enchancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size
So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got chased last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won't catch me and you

Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in a riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy island, time-traveling diamond
Could a shaped heartaches
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?

Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?

Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Are you mine?

She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?
Well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright
She's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore
Well, she's talkin', but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh, I'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew how she could have anyone she wants
And I'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

Like, I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine
Really, love, it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
She said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
I heard the truth was built to bend 
A mechanism to suspend the guilt 
Is what you are requiring still 
You've got to dance little liar 

Just like those fibbs that pop and fizz 
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
And you're bound to trip 
And she'll detect the fiction on 
Your lips and dig a contradiction up 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt beneath the dirt 
The liar take a lot less time 

I'm sure it's clear and plain to me 
Its not an alibi you need just yet 
Oh no it's something for those beads of sweat 
Yes that we'll get you back to normal 

And after you have dabbed the patch you'll grieve 
And then proceed to scratch the varnish off 
That newly added calmness 
So as not to raise any alarms too soon 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt beneath the dirt 

The liar takes a lot less 

Time to decide on his saunter 
Have you got itchy bones 
And in all your time alone 
Can you hack your mind being riddled 
With the wrong memories 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt between the dirt
There's a room for the trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones that make sinners out of such lovely lads

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end

There's a room for the trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones that make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
All the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around just so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end
I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan, has he got one
You better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true
I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
And I never will

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we got in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said
I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires
Despair to the point will they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top one hundred list

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

She saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says 'we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around

When did your list replace the twist and turn
Ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker
Assuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?
What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth…

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
Though it caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger 
Move over toward the danger THAT you seek 

You think excitement has receded 
And the mirror distracts 
The logic of the trance
Quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless 
And weightless, your imagination roams 

And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

In the moonlight they're more thrilling
Those things that he knows 
As he leads you through the grinning
Bubble blowers in the snow 
Watching his exit 
Is like falling off the ferry in the night 

The inevitables gather to push you around 
Any old voice makes a punishing sound 
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was 

And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me,

Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate,

I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained
Have you got color in your cheeks'
Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something's in your teeth
And some aces up your sleeve
I had no idea that you're in deep
I dreamt about you near me every night this week
How many secrets can you keep'
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
When I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you.

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together, if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (calling when you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you, (do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know)
Do you want me crawling back to you?
A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

Jealously in Technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Street lamp amber, wanderlust
Hide her in a blunderbus

She looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one,
That time has got it in for honey

That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
In a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright; he couldn't wait to get away
I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted

Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
Well, all the little promises - they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Years Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know
I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The first thing that she said

Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
But one you could never bring yourself to hate

And she said we've got that spark
That only lights a fuse
Helps you see in the dark
But it's a sight you'll lose when
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
One that made you steal and set things on fire
But one you haven't seen of late

And I said that kind of talk
Only adds intrigue
To the cauldron of thought
It's already exceeding
Temptation, the very thing that held her back

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it

And your hands where I can

We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends
Caused enticement in the air
I mean day 'n' night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, joyriding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless gangsters, no direction
No sign of correction
But then I switched it off
Changed my ways
What the hell
Like oh my days
But like my naughty friends
They're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just what
But its hard to fight the temptation son

The panic will fall down around you
If you don't do what I say

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can
Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And does it get on your nerves, make it slightly perturbed
That there's things that you don't know about her
And even the places that she's never been with you
Seem awful empty without her

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And with the needle in groove, is there all to prove
And tell me are your feet still tapping?
I know there's a first for a trip over the water
What is the worst that could happen?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?
So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower knowing full well that I don't
I may suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem

The look of love
The rush of blood
The "she's with me"
The Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs
The camera plus
The black and white and the colour dodge
The good time girls
The cubicles
The house of fun
The number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road, ooh ooh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?
You've never met before
But still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
She's definitely one of those
Where you go wherever she goes

Oh my body and my mind
Both start talking at the exact same time
Try'na think of ways to make her mine
But they're difficult to find

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

And she said: 'Oh, well I knew this will sound cold
But I really have to go
Oh it's not that I'm not free
There's nowhere I need to be
It's just your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me'

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

She said: I baby I can never leave you
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck
No point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

It's more a hunger than a thirst
You'll break it out the second time
Before you know about the first
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
But you'll let her do her worst

And it's not hard to tell
It's obvious the other angels faces fell
When she told them that she had to go
Traded her wings and overcoat for something colorful

(Tha knows)
Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
Oh she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank
And I'm not having a nice time"

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
Yeah I'm sure it's pretty far

And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults and it leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow her candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Oh, and in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun

Well did you ever get the feeling
Did you think she set the fall
Her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
What you waiting for to sing another fuckin'

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Well, I wrote my number down. 
I'd never wrote it down before. 
I was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
I didn't have the bottle at all. 

Well I had a look and you kept staring. 
Your head pairing up with mine 
Cos your so pretty and I'm so shy. 
You proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
Well I went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
And I felt regret. 
But in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
Cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

And when i did I couldn't see your face 
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
I dashed around to find you 
But you were nowhere to be seen 
Oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na nooooo 

Well yeah she flew away. 
She seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

Yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
Your so pretty and i'm so shy 
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet
For acrobatic blood 
Flow constanting her?
Her cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Hear who's your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots
Give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood?
Constanting her?
Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Lyrics
I etched a face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Mystery's flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes

I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Oh, piledriver
You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches 
A welcome threatening stir 

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true 
Depends who you prefer 

But if it's true you're gonna run away 
Tell me where 
I'll meet you there 

Am I snapping the excitement 
If I pack away the laguther 
And tell you how it feels 

And does burden come to meet ya 
If I've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel 

The day after you stole my heart, 
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you 

And you're hiding in my soup 
And the book reveals your face 
And there's a splashing in my eyelids 
The concentration continually breaks 

I did request the mark you cast 
Didn't heal as fast 
I hear your voice in silences 
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud? 

And the jostling crowd 
You're not allowed to tell the truth 
And the photo booth's a liar 
And the sharpened explanations 

But there's no screaming reason to inquire 
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes 
With things they never see if it smacks in their temples
I was biting the time zone, 
And we embellish the banks of our bloodstreams, 
And threw caution to the colorful 
Then we fell asleep in the car, 
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip 
And the tide took me to your mouth, 
And then swept me back down to your palms 

It's them that put me inside the reminder 
That yours is the only ocean, 
(Yours Is the only ocean) 
That I wanna swing from, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna hang on 

I've got this ego mechanic, 
She's always trying to give me vitamins 
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection, 
I preferred her as a cartoon 

If I could be someone else for a week, 
I'd spend it chasing after you, 
'Cause she's not shattering my attitude, 
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna swing from, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna hang on to 

I'm swinging on 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean
Potion approaching, shield your eyes, 
Potion approaching, visualize, 
Holding a token, swollen in size, 
Potion approaching, shield your eyes 

Oh but if we're gonna escape though, 
We really ought to think it through, 
Would you like me to build you a go kart?
Blind faith
Heartache
Mind games
Mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

And over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell em if you like
We'll tell em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

I said no
Oh no
Oh you won't get me to go
Anywhere, said anywhere
I won't go
Oh no no

Well over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
Not in the same way
Not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no
I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
What did you expect?
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile!
Won't somebody let me out!
Don't wanna stick around no more
I said they're looking at yer strange
I said yer stickin' to the floor

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Fucking hell I'll break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
Keep on stepping on your toes
I'll pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Ah ah, ah ah, oh!
Ah ah, ah ah, oh
Yea, yea, yea!

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns am I too quick to assume
That the love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune

To what they did before, her heads red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like they're happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more

And no would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She says, "see if it's still raining
I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Locked in tempestuous phase
At least that's how we felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me as sunday's frozen pitch
Fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just Postmix lemonade

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a Laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
Well I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of air without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about something
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
With the ending wreak of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone

Oh, will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you wish you'd never been born
You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
But we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
She can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
How the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks is this...
Crime!

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight

You'll be able to post any day of the most
For the sights of all time

You knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart Abba Drava
Keep on the balaclava
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Draw some ellipses to chase you round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo

Been watching all the neon blossom, flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten, where you've been
Going riding through the thunder circle, fuzz canyon
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Give me an eeny-meeny-miny-moe
Or an ipp dipp, dog-shit rock and roll
