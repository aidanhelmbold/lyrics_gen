Lyrics
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind

North is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in between is mine
I am mine

And the feeling it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

And the meaning it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significance between the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
What

And the feelings that gets left behind
All the innocent broken with lies
Significance, between the lines
(We may need to hide)

And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
Got a gun, 'fact I got two
That's okay man, 'cause I love God
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly, when armed
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun

Double think, dumb is strength
Never shot at a living thing
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly, when armed
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a

Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded
Kindred to be an American

I can feel your heart
I can feel your heart through your neck
I can feel your heart through your neck
I can steal your heart form your neck

Glorified, glorified
I admit it, what's to say, yeah
I'll relive it without pain
Hmm, backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes, I play

Once upon a time I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah

Oh, try and mimic what's insane, oh, yeah
I am in it, where do I stand?
Oh, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray

Once upon a time I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think I got my eyes closed
But I'm looking at you the whole fucking time
I'm gonna keep a look once more

Ooh, once upon a time I could control myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once, upon a time I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could love you, yeah, yeah, yeah

Once, once, once, once
Yeah, once, once, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, once


Spin me round, roll me over, fuckin' circus
Stab it down, one way needle, pulled so slowly
Drains and spills, soaks the pages, fills their sponges
It's my blood, it's my blood
Paint Ed big, turn Ed into one of his enemies
It's my blood, it's my blood, it's my blood

Stab it down, fill the pages, suck my life out
Maker of my enemies, take my
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Oh, please don't go out on me
Don't go on me now
Never acted up before
Don't go on me now

I swear, I never took it for granted
Just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you
Just passing it on, go fuck

Once fastened, servile
Now your getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly
With such disarm

I pulled the covers over him
Shoulda' pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis
A fool not a fucking God
Jump, turn, search, burn

Please, don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, oh

Search, uh, touch
Please, turn on the picture
Tuck, turn, see

Please, please, please, don't go on me
Don't go on me, don't go on me
Don't go on me, don't you want me
Don't go on me, please don't go on me
Have a drink they're buying,
Bottom of, bottle of denial, 

Big guy, big eye, watching me,
Have to wonder what it sees, 
Progress, laced with, ramifications, 
Freedom's big plunge. 

Pull the innocent from a crowd, 
Raise the sticks then bring 'em down ,
If they fail to obey,
If they fail to obey. 

For every tool they lend us, a loss of independence.

I pledge to my grievance to the flag,
Cause you don't give blood, then take it back again,
We're deserving of much more.

Progress, taste it, invest-it-all,
Champagne breakfast for everyone. 

Break the innocent when they're proud,
Raise the stakes, then bring 'em down,
If they fail to obey,
If they fail to obey. 

Pledge my grievance to the flag,
Aw come on, don't give blood, then take it back again,
We're all deserving something more.

I want to breathe, part of the seen,
I want to taste, everyone I see,
I want to run, when I'm up high,
I want to run to the sea,
I only want life to be,
I just want to be,
I will feel alive as long as I am free.
A man lies in his bed in a room with no door 
He waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter
After spending half his life searching  he still felt as blank 
As the ceiling at which he stared 
He is alive  but feels absolutely nothing 
So  is he? 
When he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him 
By nine  he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact 
No tradebacks... 
So this is what it's like to be an adult 
If he only knew now what he knew then... 
I'm open... (2x) 
Come on in... (4x) 
I'm open... (2x) 
Come on in... (4x) 
I'm open... 
Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets and no covers he decides to 
Dream... 
Dream up a new self for himself...
Sliding out of reverse into drive.
This wheel will be turning right, then straight.
Off in the sunset she'll ride.

She can remember a time, denied.
Stood by the side of the road.
Spilled like wine now.
She's out on her own and line high.
 
There's no leaving here.
Ask I'm an ear.
She's disappeared now. 

They said that timing was everything.
Made him want to be everywhere.
There's a lot to be said for nowhere.
 
There's no leaving here.
Ask I'm an ear.
He's disappeared now. 
There's no leaving here.
Ask I'm an ear.
Fuck it. We'll disappear now.
If I ever were to lose you
I'd surely lose myself
Everything I have found here
I've not found by myself
Try and sometimes you'll succeed
To make this man of me
All of my stolen missing parts
I've no need for anymore

I believe
And I believe 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me

Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on a prayer
You came deep as the ocean
It's something something out there here
All the complexities and games
No one wins, but somehow, they still play
All the missing crooked hearts
They may die, but in us they live on

I believe
And I believe 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me

When hurricanes and cyclones rage
When wind turned dirt to dust
When floods they came or tides they raised ever
Closer became us

All the promises at sundown
I meant them like the rest
All the demons used to come around
I'm grateful now they've left

So persistent in my ways,
Here a angel, lying here to stay
No resistance, no alarms, please this is just too good to be gone

I believe
And I believe 'cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
You and me
It's you and me
He's got a big gold ring which says "Jesus Saves"
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day,
Where he smashed a metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss said you'd best be on your way

Oh yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
Jumping trains just to survive

Well his wife and kids' asleep but he's still awake
On his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinkin if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream

Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
To a stranger's bottom line
Oh yeah...
I've seen the light
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I'm scared of life
Near to death
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I've seen the light
Scared of life

Yeah...
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah...
Was a dream that had to die
Oh yeah...
I've seen the light
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
And I'm scared of life
Near to death
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohh ohh ohhhh...
I've seen the light
Scared of life
Ohh ohh ohhh... Ohhhhhh Ohhh..
And I'm near to death
Here to die
Scared of life
Near to death
Here to die
Scared of life...
State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and preaches, but to have an empty court, uh huh
And the signs are passin', grip the wheel, can't read it
Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah

And I listen for the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself

Lay her down as priest does, should the Lord be accountin'
Will be in my honor, make it pain, painfully quick, uh huh
Promises are whispered in the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end, end, yeah

And the barrel shakes aimed a directly at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself
And I listen from both sides of a friend
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Myself, myself

Hey, hey
Uh 
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Wanna back, back it away, yeah

And I listen, yeah, for the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Oh, ah, and the barrel waits, trigger shakes
Aimed right at my head, don't won't you help me
Help me from myself

Woo hey ooh
Hey ooh hey ooh, hey ooh
Woo, woo

State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and yeah yeah
"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Awooh...aye davanita...awooh...awooha... (4x) 

Jahooh...jahooh... (Repeat) 

Awooh...aye davanita...awooh...awooha... (4x)
Unsealed, on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, "I wanna leave it again"
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave her again

On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called and I said that I'll go
And I said that I'll call out again
And the reason I ought ta leave her calm, I know
I said, "I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah, can you see them, out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them 'round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know I don't wanna stay

Make me cry

I see oh, I don't know why there's something else
I want to, wanna drum it all away
I said, "I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah, can you see them, out the on porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them 'round the front way
And I know, and I know I don't want to stay at all
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't, I don't want to stay
Spin me round  roll me over  fuckin' circus 
Stab it down  one way needle pulled so slowly
Drains and spills soaks the pages fills their sponges 
It's my blood
Paint Ed big, Turn Ed into, One of his enemies,  
It's my blood 

Stab it down  fill the pages  suck my life out 
Maker of my enemies,  
Take, my,  
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I've got an unfortunate feelin', I've been beaten down
I feel I don't believe and now the truth is coming out
What they've taken is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence and then they throw them on a burning fire

All along they're sayin' mind your manners

I caught myself believin' that I needed God
And if it's hard for some we sure could use it now

Try my patience, my patience tried
This world's no longer good enough that makes me wanna cry

All along they're sayin' mind your manners
Silence save him

Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve a mystery
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

No longer sayin' mind your manners
Always burning

Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve a mystery
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like it
Livin' Hell

Livin' Hell!
Yesterdays, how quick they change
All lost and long gone now
It's hard to remember anything moving at the speed of sound
Moving with the speed of sound

And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
in that somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun that just don't come

Can I forgive what I cannot forget
And live a lie?
I could give it one more try

Why deny this drive inside, just looking for some peace
Every time I get me some it gets the best of me

I'm not much left, you see

And yet I'm still holdin' tight to this dream of distant light
And that, somehow I'll survive
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word that never comes

A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts
I'm wide awake and reaching out

It's gone so quiet now
Could it be I'm farther out?

Movin' faster than the speed of sound
Ah, is there room for both of us?
Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation?
Is that all we've got?
I get the words, and then I get to thinkin'
I don't wanna think, I wanna feel
And how do I feel?
And how do I
If you're the only one, will I never be enough?
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love
Swore I'd love you till the day I die, and beyond..
Are we going to the same place? if so, can I come?
It's egg rolling thick and heavy
All the past you carry
Oh, I could be new, you underestimate me
If you're the only one, will I never be enough?
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love
I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man?
Bandaged hand in hand
I find it on the run in a race that can't be won
All hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love
If you're my only one, so could you only one?
I want to be your one, enough
You won, your one, your hun
He won the lottery when he was born 
Took his mothers white breast to his tongue
Trained like dogs color and smell
Walks by me to get to him 
Police man 

He won the lottery by being born 
Big hand slapped a white male American 
Do no wrong so clean cut

Dirty his hands  it comes right off 
Police man 
Police stopped my brother again
Police man 

Jesus greets me, looks just like me

Do no wrong  so clean cut 
Dirty his hands, it comes right off 
Police man 
Police stopped my brother again
Police man 

Police stopped my brother again
Police man 

All my pieces set me free, human devices set me free
All my pieces set me free
Human devices set me free
(lies, lies, lies, lies, lies...)
(lies, lies, lies, lies, lies...)
How does he do it? How do they do it? uncanny and immutable
This is such a happening tailpipe of a party
Like sugar, the guests are so refined
A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?
He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer
Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike
Drilling for fear makes the job simple
Born on third, thinks he got a triple
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way...
I remember when you sang that song about today
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
A think tank of aloof multiplication
A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter
Retrenchment and hoggishness
The aristocrat choir sings, "what's the ruckus?"
The haves have not a clue
The immenseness of suffering
And the odd negotiation, a rarity
With onionskin plausibility of life
And a keyboard reaffirmation
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way...
I remember when you sang that song about today
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
I remember when you sang that song about today
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
Changed, changed, chains, etc...
Dirty Frank Dahmer, he's a gourmet cook, yeah 
I got a recipe for insane soup, yeah 
Wanted a pass, so she relaxed... 
Now the little groupie's getting chopped up in the back 
I Got a cupboard full of fleshy fresh ingredients 
A very careful at the same time quite expedient 
Eats meat, a release... 
Bus driving's harder on your head than on your feet 
Dirty frank (4x) 

Keeps it clean, a keeps it copacetic 
A little boys and girls, their heads are all collected 
A not crazy, a per se... 
Just a little strange, when he gets hungry 
City, state, your town, he will continue 
A stadiums, tiny clubs, every venue 
His bus, your trust... 
There goes another turned into crust
Dirty frank...a Dirty Frank, yeah... (2x) 
Yeah...oh, watch it... 

Why that dirty Frank was a bad mother...Shut your mouth! 
Hey man, I'm just talking about dirty Frank
Middle of the night, we're stopped, the freeway shoulder 
A Frank's shoveling to bury the leftovers 
They're sunk, he's drunk... 
Now he's gonna drive, I'm hiding in my bunk, oh... 
The band all knows, we're too afraid to mention 
Don't want to be part of frank's luncheon 
A-lose weight, a-be safe... 
Where's Mike McCready? 
My god, he's been ate! 
Dirty frank...a Dirty Frank, yeah... (2x) } (2x) 
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah } 

Cook 'em, just to see the look on their face... } (10x) 
Just to see the look on their face } 

Why that Dirty Frank was a bad mother...Shut your mouth! 
Hey, I'm just talking about Dirty Frank
Dirty Frank...a Dirty Frank, yeah... (2x) 
Dirty Frank (8x) 
OK, I think that's enough...
I felt the earth on Monday 
It moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper 
Laid out for me to see 
Saw his face in a corner picture 
I recognized the name 
Could not stop staring at the 
Face I'd never see again 

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when
A war has taken over? 
It's the same every day 
I heard my name 
What can be saved and
Who will be left to hold her? 

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 
The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide
Medals on a wooden mantle 
Next to a handsome face 
That the president took for granted
Writing checks the whole world pays 
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and naive
Too much to talk about 
And nothing for to say 

It's the same every day 
And the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder
Laying claim to the take 
That our soldiers save
Does not equate, and 
The truth's already out there

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 
The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide
Looking in the eyes of the fallen 
You've got to know there's another
Another
Another
Another
Another

Way

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when
The war has taken over
It's the same every day 
And the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder 

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide 

The whole world
World over 
It's a world wide suicide
There's a light, when my baby's in my arms,
There's a light, when the window shades are drawn,

Hesitate, when I feel I may do harm to her,
Watch it all, cause this feeling we can share.

And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air.

Byzantine is reflected in our pond,
There's a cloud, but the water remains calm,
Reaching in, the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass,
Even out, it's a precious thing to bear.

And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart, in thin air.

It's not in my past to presume,
Love can keep on moving in both directions.
How to be happy and true,
Is the quest we're taking on together,

Taking on, on, on, on,
Taking on, on, on, on, on, on.

There's a light, when my baby's in my arms,

And I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart.
There is a marker
No one sees it 'cause the sand
Has covered over all the messages it kept
Misunderstanding, what original truth was
And out expanding, in a faith, but not in love

What went wrong?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Do come down

With the living let what is living love
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first

God, what do you say?

Those undecided needn't have faith to be free
And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be
Now you got both sides claiming killing in god's name
But god is nowhere to be found, conveniently

What goes on?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Walk the bridges before you burn them down
Do come round

With the living let what is living love
Unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first

God, what do you say? What do you say?

I feel a sickness. A sickness coming over me
Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea
And the solution? Well, from me far would it be
But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me

What goes wrong?

Walking tightrope high over moral ground
Seeing visions of falling up somehow
Do come down

With the living, let what is living love
Are forgiving, yet needing forgiveness first

What do you say? God, what do you say?
What do you say?

Calling out, calling out
Calling out, calling out
What used to be a house of cards
Has turned into a reservoir
Save the tears that were water falling
Let's go swim tonight, darling

And once outside the undertow
Just you and me, and nothing more
If not for love, I would be drowning
I've seen it work both ways

But I am up riding high amongst the waves
Where I can feel like I
Have a soul that has been saved
Where I can feel like I've
Put away my early grave

I gotta say it now
Better loud than too late

Remember back, the early days
When you were young, and less amazed
Suddenly the channel changed
The first time you saw blood

Cut to later, now you're strong
You've bled yourself, the wounds are gone
It's rare when there is nothing wrong
Survived and you're amongst the fittest

Love ain't love until you feel it
Up riding high amongst the waves

I can feel like I
Have a soul that has been saved
I can see the light
Coming through the clouds in rays

I gotta say it now
Better loud than too late
I gotta say it now
Better loud than too late

Hey yeah

Riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I
Have a soul that has been saved
I can see the light
Coming through the clouds in rays

I gotta say it now
Better loud than too late

I gotta say it now
Better loud than too late

Say it now
Better loud than too late
This broken wheel is coming undone 
And the road's exploding 
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you 
Love is a tower, and you're the key 
Leading me higher, when you let me in 
Keeping us close (so close)
Oh, on down the line 
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun 
With no one knowing 
But you're keeping me strong
Moving along with you
You are a tower, of strength to me 
The darkening hour, sees light again
Again...
Ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are...
Love is a tower, of strength to me 
I am the shoreline, but you're the sea
The sea
You are, you are...
...
Woo
I'm ahead, I'm a man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in god I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby

I'm at piece, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby

I'm a thief, I'm a liar
There's my church, I sing in the choir:
(Hallelujah, hallelujah)

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, admire my clones
'Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
Nothin', why? 
Because it's evolution, baby! 

I am ahead, I am advanced
I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher
2010, watch it go to fire
It's evolution, baby
Do the evolution
Come on, come on, come on
She comes on like a stone
But you don’t know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high
Shes looking for a place to land
She said you got yourself some sand
And whatever you’d reply she took as yes

She comes out the deep?
With her newly planted seeds and soon you’re
Thrown down on your knees and then you’re dead
Then before you know the weeds are all beastly overgrown
With all the wild seeds he sews in your sleeve

You’ve got to know you’ll never let her go
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!

Always something and never nothing
Isn’t that the way we’re taught to be, to be?
Through the worn our pages
In stages when you knew not who to be
Yeah! yeah!
Until the lightning strike sets you free, yeah!

You’ve got to know you’ll never let her go
She is lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!
Lightning bolt!

The crashing stormy waves are over shoreline everyday
Until the castle on her waves turns to sand
She holds her lovely breast as her birds fall from her nest
Flying towards the great northwest, yeah you were here

And with no repair in sight
There is no god with such might
As you open her world wide with such a view
And your death will soon arrive as she finally decides
That all her problems, they won’t die with you

A-yeah! a-yeah! a-yeah!
Never let her go
She’s a lightning bolt
Never let her go
She’s true

She's rock 'n roll
She's a lightning bolt
Uncontrollable
Like you
The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lay alone just like before

I take the poor man's path I must refuse your test
Push me and I will resist
This behaviours not unique
I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it of in blood let, I be wed

I'm already cut up an half dead
I'll end up alone like I began
Everything has chains absolutely nothings changed
Take my hand not my picture spill my tincture

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't be what you want because I'm

I ain't supposed to be just fun
Oh to live and die let it be done
I figure I'll be dammed
All alone like I began
When the spoon is hot
And the needles sharp
And you drift away
I can hear you say
That the world in black
Is upon your back
And your body shakes
So you ditch away
And you close the shades

Don't try to do it
Don't try to kill your time
You might do it
Then you cant change your mind
You've got a hold on to your time
Till your break through these
Times of trouble

When you try to talk
And the words get hard
And they put you down
Don't you stay
Don't you ditch away

I saw you swinging
Swinging your mothers sword
I know you're playing but
Sometimes the rules get hard
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
If somebody loved you and left you for dead
You got to hold on to your time till you break
Through these times of trouble
Don't you think you oughta rest? 
Don't you think you oughta lay you head down? 
Don't you think you want to sleep? 
Don't you think you oughta lay your head down tonight? 

Don't you think you've done enough? 
Oh  don't you think you've got enough  well maybe... 
You don't think there's time to stop 
There's time enough for you to lay your head down tonight tonight 

Let it wash away 
All those yesterdays 

What are you running from? 
Taking pills to get along
Creating walls to call your own 
So no one catches you? drifting off and 
Doing all the things that we all do 

Let them wash away 
All those yesterdays 
All those yesterdays 
All those paper plates 

You've got time, you've got time to escape
There's still time, it's no crime to escape 
It's no crime to escape, it's no crime to escape
There's still time, so escape 
It's no crime, crime...

All those yesterdays {9X}
Here's a token of my openness 
Of my need to not disappear 
How I'm feeling  so revealing to me 
I found my mind too clear 
I just need someone to be there for.. me 
I just want someone to be there for.. me 

All the static in my attic a 
Shoots down my side nerve 
To the ocean of my platitudes
Longitudes latitudes  it's so absurd 
I just need someone to be there for.. 
I just want someone to be there for.. 
Someone to be there for.. 

Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
I'm not trying to make a difference 
I'll stop trying to make a difference 

No way 

Ooh, let's call in an angel
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
I'm not trying to make a difference 
I'll stop trying to make a difference 

No way 

Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference 
I'm not trying to make a difference 
I'm not trying to make a difference 
No way 
No way, no way 
Let's call in an angel 
Who's calling an angel?
I don't mind
Stealing Bread
From the mouths of decadence

But I can't feed on the powerless 
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table, 
The fire's cooking
And they're starving babies,
And the slaves are all working
Blood is on the table,
The mouths are choking

I'm going hungry

I don't mind
Stealing Bread
From the mouths of decadence

But I can't feed on the powerless 
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table, 
The fire's cooking
And they're starving babies,
And the slaves are all working

And it's on the table,
The mouths are choking

I'm going hungry
They don't eat  don't sleep
They don't feed  they don't seethe
Bare their gums when they moan and squeak
Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet
They don't push  don't crowd
Congregate until they're much too loud
Fuck to procreate till they are dead
Drink the blood of their so called best friend

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

They don't scam, don't fight
Don't oppress an equals given rights
Starve the poor so they can be well fed
Line their holes with the dead ones bread

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

Rats, They don't compare
Ben, the two of us need look no more
I'm wishing you a well...mind at peace within yourself... 
Covers up  I cast you off...I'll be watching as you breathe.... 
I'd lie still  you move  I'd send you off around the bend... 
I hold your head deep in my arms...my fingertips they close your 
Eyes... 
Off you dream  my little child...there's a sun around the bend... 
There's a sun around the bend... 
All the evenings close like this...all these moments that I've 
Missed... 
Please forgive, won't you, dear? 
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend... 
You're an angel when you sleep... 
How I want your soul to keep of and all around the bend...
Unsealed
On a porch a letter sat
Then you said I want to leave it again

Once I saw him
On a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I want to leave it again

On a weekend want to wish it all way
And they called an I said an I want what
I said an I call out again

And the reason oughta leave her calm I know
I said I know what I wear that a box or the bag

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay

Make me cry

I see
I don't know there's something else
I want to drum it all away
An I said
"I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
Climbing on the mountain, floating out on the sea 
Far from lights of a city, the elements they speak to me 
Whispering that life, existed long before greed 
And balancing the world on its knee 
Don't see some men as half empty, see them half full of shit 
Thinking that we're all but slaves
There ain't gonna be
No middle anymore, it's been said before 
The haves be having more, yet still bored 
Won't someone save? 
Won't someone save the world? 
Won't...
Won't...
Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette
Thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic 
What's missing? He's living a day he'll soon forget 

That's one more time around, the sun is going down 
The moon is out, but he's drunk and shouting, putting people down 
He's pissing, he's living a day he'll soon forget
Counts his money every morning, the only thing that keeps him horny
Locked in a giant house, that's alarming 
The townsfolk, they all laugh
Sorry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent 
Seems the more you make equals the loneliness you get 
And it's fitting, he's barely living a day he'll soon forget 

That's one more time around, and there is not a sound 
He's lying dead, clutching Benjamins, never put the money down 
He's stiffening, we're all whistling, a man we'll soon forget
Freezin'  rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again 
Oh  Feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days 
Oh  hand out  faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar 
Oh  dark grin  he can't help when he's happy he looks insane 
Even flow 

Thoughts arrive like butterflies 
Oh  he don't know 
So he chases them away 
Someday yet he'll begin his life again 
Life again
Kneelin'  looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read 
Prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything 
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way, yeah 
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame 
Even flow 

Thoughts arrive like butterflies 
Oh, he don't know 
So he chases them away 
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away 
Him away, him away 
Yeah! 
Woo 
Oh yeah yeah
See it happen to a couple of friends
See it happen and the message it sends
Taking off for what's an obvious fall
Just to see what all the fuss is about
It's not your way...not your way...
It's not your way...yeah...
Another habit sentence him up with you
Another habit says he's long overdue
Another habit like an unwanted friend
I'm so happy with my righteous self...
It's not your way...not your way...
It's not your way...
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)
I never thought you, never thought you...
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)
I never thought you, never, never thought you...
Never thought you'd habit... (6x)
Speaking as a child of the nineties...
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)
I never thought you, never thought you...
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)
I never thought you, never, never thought you...
Never...never me...never you...never me...
Ah is there room for both of us? Both of us apart? 
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got? 
I get the words and then I get to thinkin' 
But I don't want to think I want to feel! 
How do I feel? And how do I... 
If you're the only one well I'll never be enough yeah... 
Hail hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah... 
A how I love you till the day I die...ah and beyond... 
Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come? 
It's egg rollin' thick and heavy...all the past we carry... 
Oh, I could be new...you underestimate me... 
If you're the only one, well I'll never be enough, yeah... 
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah... 
I sometimes realize...I could only be as good as you'll let me... 
Are you woman enough to be my man? Bandaged hand in hand... 
Yeah... 
I find it on my run in a race that can't be won, yeah... 
All hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah... 
If you're my only one...so good, you only one... 
I want to be your one...enough, you won...your one...your hun...
Understand She's a Force of Nature
Contraband hiding deep inside her soul
Exercising her will to lose control
She lets go

Common Man he don't stand a chance no
One to love who allowed his in the hole
No way to save someone who wont take the role
And just let's go

One Man Stands the edge of the ocean
A beacon on dry land
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the dawn

Hurricane has the trade winds blowing
Gale force shaking windows in the storm
Shipwreck from a love that he calls home
One light on

Somewhere there's a siren singing
Solemnly he hears
All the strengths you might think would
Disappear resolving

One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the
Darkness leaves the dawn

Makes me ache
Makes me shake
Is it so wrong to think that
Love can keep us safe?

Last I saw he was out there waiting
A silhouette in the black light full moon
In the sand there he stands upon the shore
Forevermore
Somewhere there's a siren singing
Solemnly he hears
All the strength
That you might think would disappear, resolving

One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes are closed, you cannot know
But his heart don't seem to know
Grow
Home
You never listen to a word I said
You only seen me
For the clothes I wear
Or did the interest go so much deeper
It must have been
The length of my hair

The public image

What you wanted was never made clear
Behind the image was ignorance and fear
You hide behind this public machine
Still follow the same old scheme
Public image

Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
I will not be a property
Public image

Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
It's not a game of monopoly
Public image
Public image
You got what you wanted
The public image belongs to me
It's my entrance
My own creation
My grand finale
My goodbye
Public image
Public image
Goodbye
Sailing on my every step. Inching off of the earth.
Is magnified by the things I've done.
The thing that I've become.

Every lift of my hand. Coffee cup up, and back.
Is magnified by the things I've done. The things I've seen. the things I've caused.

I'm a dead man walking.

The hammer that I once brung down now hovers over me.
Cast a shadow across, onto me.

The hallways are all mocking me.
What I've become they're all mocking me.

I'm a dead man walking. A dead man walking. A dead man walking.
I'm a dead man walking. Dead man walking. Dead man walking.
At home
Drawing pictures
Of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a V

Dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember
Pickin' on the boy

Seemed a harmless little fuck
But we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth

And bit the recessed lady's breast
How could I forget
He hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting
Dropped wide open
Just like the day
Like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection

And the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this,
Try to erase this,
From the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in
spoke in
Jeremy spoke in
spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
Is this just another day, this God forgotten place? 
First comes love, then comes pain let the games begin,
Questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable

Love boat captain
Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here
It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough
All you need is love

Is this just another phase, earthquakes making waves,
Trying to shake the cancer off, stupid human beings,
Once you hold the hand of love, it's all surmountable

Hold me, and make it the truth,
That when all is lost there will be you,
'Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word I still believe
And it's love

It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey,
Lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today
And if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret? 

And the young, they can lose hope 'cause they can't see beyond today,
The wisdom that the old can't give away
Hey,
Constant recoil, sometimes life
Don't leave you alone

Hold me, and make it the truth,
That when all is lost there will be you
'Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word that I still believe and it's
Love, love love love love

Love boat captain take the reigns
Steer us towards the clear
I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough
Love is all you need, all you need is love,
Love, love
Alone listless breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violin's center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud, child, tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, into her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go down

I see a girl of the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Oh, next to a garbage can

Now she's put her kid away
She's going to get a hit
She hates her life
And what she's done with it

That's one more kid
That'll never go to school
Never get to fall in love
Never get to be cool

That's one more kid
That'll never go to school
Never get to fall in love
Never get to be cool

He won the lottery
When he was born
A big hand slapped
The white male American

Do no wrong
So clean cut
Dirties his hands
It comes right off
Police man, police man
Hey...oooh...
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay.
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Shade beneath the clouds
Of what was everything?
Oh, the pictures seared all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter,
So why do I sear?
And twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures seared all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be...yeah

Uh huh...uh huh...ooh...
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine
"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I admit it, what's to say
I'll relive it, without pain
Backstreet lover on the side
Of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a .16 gauge buried
Under my clothes, I play

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Oh try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?

Indian summer I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket
So determined
Discreet, I pray.

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could love myself
Once upon a time I could love you
Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
Yeah yeah
Yes I understand
That every life must end
As we sit alone
I know someday we must go

Yeah I'm a lucky man
To count on both hands
The ones I love
Some folks just have one
Yeah others they got none

Stay with me
Let's just breathe
Practised on our sins
Never gonna let me win
Under everything
Just another human being

I don't want to hurt
There's so much in this world
To make me believe

Stay with me
All I see

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
What if I did and I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
'Cause I come clean

I wonder everyday
As I look upon your face
Everything you gave
And nothing you would take
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
What if I did and I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
I come clean
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me 'till I die
Meet you on the other side
I used to be crustacean
In an underwater nation
And I surf in celebration
Of a billion adaptations

Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave

I feel the need
Planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see
The oceans size?
Defining time
And tide
Arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind
To let me ride

I scream in affirmation
Of connecting dislocations
And exceeding limitation
By achieving levitation

Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.

I feel the need
Planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see
The oceans size?
Defining time
And tide
Arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind
To let me ride

Got me a ride
I got me a ride
The direction of the eye
So misleading
The defection of the soul
Nauseously quick
I don't question
Our existence
I just question
Our modern needs

I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of stone
After all is done
And we're still alone
I won't be taken
Yet I'll go

With my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of stone

I don't show
I don't share
I don't need
What you have to give, yeah

I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of
I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, into your garden
But I don't know
I don't know
I don't care
I don't need your
Got all night
Plenty of time
Take these chains
From my eyes

So alive
Gettin 'it prime
Take 'em there
Before you die

Why be satisfied
We've got all night
Please be here
Top of the stairs

No place for
The president
Build some fears
Left outside

Fuck, be content
To just get by
Why be satisfied
We've got all night

You scream and wail
You see who cares
Scream and wail
See who cares

Life has nothin' to do with
Killin' time
So why be satisfied
We've got... all night

We've got all night
We've got all night...
Waitin'
Watching the clock
Its four o'clock
Its got to stop
Tell him
Take no more 
She practices her speech
As he opens the door
She rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over 

She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a betterman
She dreams in color
She dreams in red
Can't find a betterman
Can't find a betterman
Can't find a betterman

Ooh

Talking to her self 
There's no one else who needs to know
She tells her self ooh
Memories back when she was bold and strong 
And waiting for the world
To come along
Swears she knew it as
As she's swears he's gone

She lies and says she still loves with him
Can't find a betterman

Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Yeah

Yeah I been thinkin', I already know
Nothin' 'bout nothin' or so I have been told, yeah
I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold
Cut the crease and put the shit in the whole, yeah

Supersonic, gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yet
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah

Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear, need to feel it loud yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full

Supersonic, gone and took my soul
I stopped the rhythm but my clock was full, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah

Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear it, need to feel it loud, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full, yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah

So don't be shy
Just let your feelings roll on by

Or no one will know you're there
You know love is better than a song
Love is where
All of us belong
Belong

Lives opened and trashed..."Look ma, watch me crash..."
No time to question...why'd nothing last... 
Grasp and hold on...hold tight and fast... 
Soon be over...and I will relent... 
Let the ocean swell dissolve 'way my past 
Three days  and maybe longer  won't even know I've left 
Under your tongue...I'm like a tab... 
I will give you what...you're not supposed to have... 
Under my breath...I swear by sin... 
For better or for worse...a best we began... 
Let the sun climb, oh, burn away my mask 
Three days, and maybe longer, shed my skin at last...shed...shed... 
Let the sun shine, burn away my mask 
Three days, and maybe longer, won't ever find me here 
Let the ocean dissolve away my past 
Four days, and not much longer... 
Let my spirit pass... 
Ooh... 
This is, this is...(3x) 
My...last exit
And the rivers shall open for the righteous 
And the rivers shall open for the righteous 
And the rivers shall open for the righteous, someday

I went walking, with my brother
And he wondered, oh, how I am
Said what I believe with my soul
Ain't what I see with my eyes
And there's no turning back this time
I am a patriot, and I love my country
Because my country is all I know
I want to be with my family
People who understand me
I got no place else to go...
I am a patriot...

I was walking with my girlfriend.
She looked so fine, I said
"Baby, what's on your mind?"
Said I want to run like the lions
Released from their cages...
Released from the rages
Burning in my soul tonight.

I am a patriot, and I love my country
Because my country is all I know

And I ain't no communist,
And I ain't no socialist,
And I ain't no capitalist,
And I ain't no imperialist,
And I ain't no democrat,
Sure ain't no republican either,
I only know one party,
And that is Freedom.
I am... I am... I am...

I am a patriot, and I love my country,
Because my country is all I know.

And the rivers shall open for the righteous,
And the rivers shall open for the righteous,
And the rivers shall open for the righteous Someday...
Someday... Someday...
At home 
Drawing pictures 
Of mountain tops 
With him on top 
Lemon yellow sun 
Arms raised in a V 

Dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention 
To the fact that mommy didn't care 
King Jeremy the wicked
Ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember
Pickin' on the boy 

Seemed a harmless little fuck 
But we unleashed a lion 
Gnashed his teeth 

And bit the recessed lady's breast 
How could I forget 
He hit me with a surprise left 
My jaw left hurting
Dropped wide open 
Just like the day 
Like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection 

And the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear 
King Jeremy the wicked
Ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today 

Try to forget this,
Try to erase this,
From the blackboard.
Wide awake like snakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had a woman long as he can remember
His to forget, but he can't, he can't

Out of bed and he dreams in the shower
She's standing naked, he's apologizing
Reaches for her and the water turns red
Got woken up to be burned, burned, again

Go it alone
You got it, so it goes
Got his knees to his face
He can't take it any other way

On the streets he's a walking wounded
Having nothing he's got nothing to say
Thoughts of suicide and alleviation
Anything to get his heart off of the coals

Go it alone
You got it, so it goes
Got his knees to his face
He can't take it for another day

Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had his woman long as he can remember
Sears to forget, but he can't, he can't
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally, take my hand
Well travel south, 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder

The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
(it's only) teenage wasteland

They're all wasted!
All these... 
I got bugs 
I got bugs in my room 
Bugs in my bed 
Bugs in my ears 
Their eggs in my head 
Bugs in my pockets 
Bugs in my shoes 
Bugs in the way I feel about you 
Bugs on my window
Trying to get in 
They don't go nowhere
Waiting waiting... 
Bugs on my ceiling
Crowded the floor
Standing sitting kneeling... 
A few block the door 
And now the question's: 
Do I kill them? 
Become their friend? 
Do I eat them? 
Raw or well done? 
Do I trick them? 
I don't think they're that dumb 
Do I join them? 
Looks like that's the one 
I got bugs on my skin 
Tickle my nausea 
I let it happen again 
They're always takin' over 
I see they surround me, I see... 
See them deciding my fate 
Oh, that which was once...was once up to me... 
Now it's too late 
I got bugs in my room...one on one 
That's when I had a chance 
I'll just stop now 
I'll become naked 
And with the...I'll become one
This is a public service announcement
With guitar
Know your rights
Number one
You got a right not to kill
Murder is a crime
Unless it is done
Unless it is done by a policeman
Or an aristocrat
Oh, know your rights
Number two
You have the right to food money
Provided at cost, 
You don't mind a little investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Perhaps retaliation
Know you rights
These are your rights
Know your
Know these rights
Number three
You have the right to free speech
As long as you're not dumb enough to actually try it
Know your rights
These are your rights
Know your rights
These are your rights
For freedom
Ha!
Maybe it's been suggested in some quarters,
That this is not enough
So get up, get up and scream, oh!
Get up and scream, ah oh!
Son she said 
Have I got a little story for you 
What you thought was your daddy
Was nothin' but a fool 

While you were sittin' 
Home alone at age thirteen 
Your real father was dyin' 
Sorry you didn't see him 
But I'm glad we talked,  

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, hey, I, oh, I'm still alive 
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive

Oh she walks slowly
Across a young man's room 
She said I'm ready, for you 
I can't remember anything 
To this very day 
'Cept the look, yeah the look
Oh, you know where
  
Now I can't see, I just stare 
I, I, I'm still alive 
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive

I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh yeah

Is something wrong 
She said 
Of course there is 
You're still alive 
She said 
Oh do I deserve to be?
And is that the question? Oh
And if so, if so
Who answers? 
Who answers? 

I, I, I'm still alive 
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a hopeless situation 
And I'm starting to believe 
That this hopeless situation 
Is what I'm trying to achieve 
But I try to run on 
It's all or none
All or none...
Here's the selfless confession
Leading me back to war 
Can we help that our destinations 
Are the ones we've been before? 
I still try to run on 
But it's all or none
All or none...
To myself, I surrender 
To the one I'll never please 
But I still try to run on 
No, I still try to run on 
But it's all or none
All or none...
Big man stands behind an open door 
Said, leave your lady on the cement floor. 
Got some kicks, want to take a ride?
I said, yeah!
"Take your pick, leave yourself behind"
I said, yeah!

I've no fear but for falling down 
So look out below I am falling now 
Oh please understand I just need, my friend, 
A way a way a way home 

Tried to walk, found a severed hand 
Recognized it by the wedding band 

Said it's ok, do you want some more?
I said, yeah!
Said you'll see dragons after three or four
I said, yeah!

Under stand I'm not falling down
I said, look around, the rooms taller now, 
I can't close my eyes, 
Cause I see the sound in waves 
In wave, lets me stay calm 

If I don't lose control
Explore and not explode 
A preternatural other plane 
With the power to maintain 

Like a tear in all we know 
Once dissolved we are free to grow 
What is human, what is more? 
I'll answer this when I get home
She nursed him there  ooh  over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say, what to say
But soon she was down  soon he was low
At a quarter past, a holy no,
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold  oh, she folded,
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh  a dissident  a dissident is here

And to this day  she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing said, what a waste
When she had contact, with the conflict,
There was meaning, but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, she folded,
A dissident is here
Escape is never, the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here

She gave him away when she couldn't hold, no, she folded,
A dissident is here
Escape is never, the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
Couldn't hold on, she couldn't hold, no, she folded,
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
A dissident is here
Don't feel like home 
Ease a little out 
And all these words alone is nothing like a poem 
Putting in, inputting in 
Don't feel like methadone 
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone 

It's nothing as it seems 
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

One uninvited chromosome
A blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes
Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding, rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home

And all that he frees
A little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see it's home
I will come to you in the daytime
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go runnin' down your street
I will squeeze the life right out of you
I will make you laugh, I'll make you cry
And we may never forget it
As I make you call my name

As I shout it to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
And you will throw your arms around me
I will come to you at night time
I will climb into your bed
I will kiss you in 155 places

As I go runnin' round in your head
I will squeeze the life right out of you
I will make you laugh, I'll make you cry
And we may never forget it
As I make you call my name
As I shout it to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
And you will throw your arms around me
Oh, and you will throw your arms around me
One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five against one
Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one

Torture from you to me
Abducted from the street

I'd rather be,
I'd rather be with,
I'd rather be with an animal

Why would you want to hurt me? Oh
So frightened of your pain
oh yeah, ooh

I'd rather be,
I'd rather be with,
I'd rather be with an animal
I'd rather be,
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with an animal

I'd rather be,
I'd rather be with,
I'd rather be with an animal
I'd rather be,
I'd rather, rather be, oh
rather be with an animal

Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one
One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, five, five, five against one, said
Up here in my tree  yeah... 
Newspapers meant enough to me  yeah...no... 
No more crowbars to my head  yeah... 
I'm trading stories with the leaves instead  yeah... 
Wave to all my friends  yeah... 
They don't seem to notice me  no... 
All their eyes trained on the street  yo  oh... 
Sidewalk cigarettes and scenes  yeah...yeah... 
Up here so high I start to escape 
Up here so high  the sky I scrape 
I'm so high  I hold just one breath here within my chest 
Just like innocence... 
I remember him, yeah... 
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah... 
They say knowledge is a dream, yeah... 
He's growing up just like me, yeah... 
I'm so light, the wind he shakes 
I'm so high, the sky I scrape, yeah... 
I'm so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest 
Sleep with innocence... 
Up here so high, the bars they break... 
Up here so high, the sky I scrape... 
Had my eyes peeled both wide open, and I got a glimpse... 
Of my innocence...got back my innocence... 
Baby, got it...still got it...
Son she said
Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy
Was nothin' but a fool

While you were sittin'
Home alone at age thirteen
Your real father was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him
But I'm glad we talked,

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive

Oh she walks slowly
Across a young man's room
She said I'm ready, for you
I can't remember anything
To this very day
'Cept the look, yeah the look
Oh, you know where

Now I can't see, I just stare
I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive

Is something wrong
She said
Of course there is
You're still alive
She said
Oh do I deserve to be?
And is that the question? Oh
And if so, if so
Who answers?
Who answers?

I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Down. Fall by the wayside no getting out.
Down. Cry me a river dried up and dammed.
The names can be changed but the place is still the same.
I am loaded. Told that all's for naught. Holds me down.

Rise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line.
Rise. You can't be neutral on a moving train.
One day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away.
And if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done.

Won't let the light escape from me.
Won't let the darkness swallow me.

So long.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh

When something's dark, let me shed a little light on it
When something's cold, I wanna put a little fire on it
If something's old, I wanna put a bit of shine on it
When something's gone, I wanna fight to get it back again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When something's broke, I wanna put a little fixin' on it
If something's bored, I wanna put a little excited on it
If something's low, I wanna put a little high on it
If something's lost, I wanna fight to get it back again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When signals cross, I wanna put a little straight on it
If there's no love, I wanna try to love again

I'll say your prayers, I'll take your side
Oh, I'll find us a way to make light
I'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing
What's saved us could be one last lifetime
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
 
You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more
 
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
I will light the match this mornin'  so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent  for soon light will be gone 
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam 
Oh I will make my way  through  one more day in, hell
How much difference does it make 
How much difference does it make  yeah

I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm 
Oh  I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired 
Oh  I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind 
Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind 
How much difference does it make 
How much difference does it make, how much difference

I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune 
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room 
How much difference 
How much difference does it make
Clouds roll by 
Reeling is what they say
Or is it just my way? 

Wind blows by  low light 
Side tracked  low light 
Can't see my tracks  your scent way back 

Can I be here all alone? 
Clear a path to my home 
Blood runs dry 
Books and jealousy tell me wrong 
All I feel  calm 
Voice blows by  low light 
Car crash  low light 
Can't wear my mask  your first  my last 

Voice goes by 
Two birds is what they'll see 
Getting lost upon their way 
Wind rolls by, low light 
Eye sight, low light 
I need the light 
I'll find my way from wrong, what's real? 
The dream I see
She don't wander in
Don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here
Don't wander in here

The direction of the eye, so misleading
The defection of the soul, nauseously quick
I don't question our existence
I just question our modern needs

She don't wander in
Don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here

I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face down
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone, yeah

After all is done and we're still alone
I won't be taken

Yet I'll go with my hands bound
I will walk with my face down
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone

I don't show, I don't share
I don't need, yeah
What you have to give, yeah

Oh, I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face down
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden oh

I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk into your garden, garden of stone

I don't know, I don't care
I don't need you for me to live
On the edge windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a needle deep

Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom

On the edge of a know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior, the aged come
To the sky above, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a burning knife deep

Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep

On the edge of a Christmas clean love
Young virgin from heaven visiting
To the man above her
She just ain't nothing

And she doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
But he sinks himself deep

Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
Can't touch the bottom, deep
She nursed him there, ooh, over a night
Wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say, what to say
But soon she was down, soon he was low

At a quarter past a holy no
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here

And to this day, she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing to say, what a waste

When she had contact with the conflict
There was meanin', but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here, oh

She gave him away
When she couldn't hold, no, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here, oh

Couldn't hold on, she couldn't hold, no, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place, oh
A dissident is here
All in all, it's no one's fault,
Excuses turn to carbon walls,
Blame it all on chemical intercourse.

The swallowed seeds of arrogance,
Breeding in the thoughts of ten-
Thousand fools that fight irrelevance.

The full moon is dead skin,
The one down here's wearing thin,
So set up the ten pins,
As the human tide rolls in,
Like a ball that's spinning.

Bombs, dropping down,
Overhead, underground,
It's instilled, to want to live.

Bombs, dropping down, 
Please forgive, our hometown,
In our insignificance.

Turn the jukebox up, he said,
Dancing in irreverence,
Play V3, let the song protest.

The plates began to shift,
Perfect lefts come rolling in,
I was alone and far away, hey,
When I heard the band start playing,
On the lip, late take off.

Bombs, dropping down,
Overhead, underground,
It's instilled to want to live.

Bombs dropping down,
Please forgive, our hometown,
In our insignificance.

Feel like resonance of distance,
In the blood the iron lies.

It's instilled to want to live.

Bombs dropping down,
Please forgive our hometown,
In our insignificance,
Oh, in our insignificance, oh.
Vacate is the word...vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear...vessel stabbed...next up  volunteers
Vulnerable wisdom can't adhere...
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on...
But there's a trapdoor in the sun...immortality...
As privileged as a whore...victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou  how?
Surrendered...executed anyhow
Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor...
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on, too...
But saw the trapdoor in the sun...
Immortality...
I cannot stop the thought...I'm running in the dark...
Coming up a which way sign...all good truants must decide...
Oh, stripped and sold, mom...auctioned forearm...
And whiskers in the sink...
Truants move on...cannot stay long
Some die just to live...
Ohh...
Here I stand with head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
each and everyday
I can hear them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Seeing them hearing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say;
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
If I keep holding out
Will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof
It's only rain that I feel
I've been wishin' out the days
Oh oh oh
Come back

I have been planning out
All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishin' out the days
Please say that if you hadn't have gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are
Oh oh oh oh
Come back

And these days, they linger on, yeah, yeah
And in the night, I've been waiting for
A real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep

If I don't fall apart
Will my memory stay clear?
So you had to go
And I had to remain here
But the strangest thing to date
So far away and yet you feel so close
I'm not going to question it any other way
It must be an open door for you
To come back

And the days they linger on, yeah
Every night I'm waiting for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me
And it's ok

It's ok, it's ok

I'll be here
Come back, come back
I'll be here
Come back, come back
I'll be here
Come back, come back
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
I want to shake
I want to wind out
I want to leave
This mind and shout

I've lived
All this life
Like an ocean
In disguise
I don't live for ever
You can't keep
Me here

I want to race
With the sundown
I want a last breath
I don't let out

Forgive
Every being
The bad feelings
It's just me
I won't wait
For answers
You can't keep
Me here

I want to rise
And say goodnight
I want to take
A look on the other side

I've lived
All this life
It's been wonder
Full at night
I will live for ever
You can't keep
Me here
Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn

Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by
Some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
Round my head
I'm spinning
Oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away

And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures had
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All I'll be

Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be
Why can't it be mine
Is this just another day, this God forgotten place? 
First comes love, then comes pain. Let the games begin,
Questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable.

Love boat captain
Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here.
It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough.
All you need is love

Is this just another phase? earthquakes making waves,
Trying to shake the cancer off? stupid human beings,
Once you hold the hand of love, it's all surmountable.

Hold me, and make it the truth,
That when all is lost there will be you,
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word I still believe
And it's

It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey,
Lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today
And if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret? 

And the young, they can lose hope cause they can't see beyond today,
The wisdom that the old can't give away
Hey,
Constant recoil
Sometimes life
Don't leave you alone.

Hold me, and make it the truth,
That when all is lost there will be you.
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word that I still believe and it's
Love, love. Love. Love. Love.

Love boat captain
Take the reigns, steer us towards the clear.
I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough.
Love is all you need, all you need is love,
Love, love,
Love.
Father, oh, oh, oh
I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the words on a rocking horse of time
I see the verse in the rain
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Oh, dear dad, can you see me now
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, Release me
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Oh, dear dad, can you see me now
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up, release me
Release me
Release me
Release me 
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Dedi
Zakai
Oh please, let it rain today 
This city is so filthy, like my mind in ways 
Oh, was a time, like a clean, new taste
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face 
Wash my love (2x) 

Wash my love, yeah... 

Sin the sale, buying just a need 
Just who planted, all the devils seeds 
And what the truth, and the truth that lies at home 
It's on the inside, and I can't get it off, yeah... 
Wash my love (2x) 
Wash my love, yeah... 

What's clean is pure, but hey, I'm white on the outside, though I stray 
What she don't know today, might kill us both tomorrow, bring it back someway
Bring it back, bring it back, back to the clean form, to the pure form 
Wash my love (8x) 
Ooh...
Troubled souls unite we got ourselves tonight
I am fuel you are friends we got the means to make amends
I am lost I'm no guide but I'm by your side
I am right by your side

Young lover I stand
It was their idea I proved to be a man
Take my fucking hand
It was their idea I proved to be a man
Will myself to find a home a home within myself
We will find a way we will find our place

Drop the leash drop the leash
Get outta' my fuckin' face

Drop the leash, we are young
Oh, get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my, my

Delight, delight, delight in our youth
Get outta' my fuckin' face
I admit it
What's to say, what
I'll relive it
Without pain, now I'm pee pee

Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got a bomb, I pray
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could control myself, yeah

Oh, try and mimic
What's insane
I am in it
Where do I stand?
Stand, stand
Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could control myself, yeah yeah yeah

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah yeah yeah
Once, upon a time I could love myself
Once upon a time I could love you

Once, once
Once, once
Once, once
Yeah
I have not been home since you left long ago
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Counting steps, walking backwards on the road
I'm counting my way back to heaven

I can't be free with what's locked inside of me
If there was a key, you took it in your hand
There's no wrong or right, but I'm sure there's good and bad
The questions linger overhead

No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
I wish that I could hold you
I wish that I had
Thinking 'bout heaven

I let go of a rope, thinking that's what held me back
And in time I've realized, it's now wrapped around my neck
I can't see what's next, from this lonely overpass
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past

All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives
Choosing the shiny ones instead
I turned my back, now there's no turning back

No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I smile, but who am I kidding?
I'm just walking the mile, every once in a while I'll get a ride
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Thumbing my way back to heaven
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Yes I understand
That every life must end
As we sit alone
I know someday we must go

Yeah I'm a lucky man
To count on both hands
The ones I love
Some folks just have one
Yeah others they got none

Stay with me
Let's just breathe
Practised on our sins
Never gonna let me win
Under everything
Just another human being

I don't want to hurt
There's so much in this world
To make me believe

Stay with me
All I see

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
What if I did and I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
'Cause I come clean

I wonder everyday
As I look upon your face
Everything you gave
And nothing you would take
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
What if I did and I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
I come clean
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me 'till I die
Meet you on the other side
I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive

I'm out here kickin with the band
I am no longer a solitary man
Everyday my time runs out
Live like a fool, that's what I was about

Oh I belive in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

Tattooed your name on my arm
I always said my girl's a good luck charm
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live

I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive

Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

I close my eyes and think how it might be
The future's here today
It's not too late, it's not too late oh

I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
She said to me, over the phone 
She wanted to see other people 
I thought, "well then, look around, they're everywhere" 
Said that she was confused

I thought, "darling, join the club" 
24 years old, mid-life crisis
Nowadays hits you when you're young 
I hung up, she called back, I hung up again 

The process had already started 
At least it happened quick 
I swear, I died inside that night 
My friend, he called 

I didn't mention a thing 
The last thing he said was, "be sound" 
Sound
I contemplated an awful thing, I hate to admit 

I just thought those would be such appropriate last words 
But I'm still here 
And small 
So small how could this struggle seem so big? 

So big
While the palms in the breeze still blow green 
And the waves in the sea still absolute blue 
But the horror
Every single thing I see is a reminder of her 
Never thought I'd curse the day I met her 
And since she's gone and wouldn't hear 
Who would care? what good would that do? 

But I'm still here 
So I imagine in a month or 12 
I'll be somewhere having a drink
Laughing at a stupid joke 

Or just another stupid thing 
And I can see myself stopping short
Drifting out of the present
Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep 

And there I am, standing 
Wet grass and white headstones all in rows 
And in the distance there's one, off on its own 
So I stop, kneel 

My new home
And I picture a sober awakening, a re-entry into this little bar scene 
Sip my drink til the ice hits my lip 
Order another round 

And that's it for now 
Sorry
Never been too good at happy endings
No more upset mornings
No more trying evenings
It's the American Dream I am disbelieving.

When the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank
I'm gonna blow it all this time, take me one last ride.

The lights of the city, they only look good when I'm speeding
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone
Gone, going for it all this time, gone.

In the far off distance
As my taillights fade
No one to witness but they will someday

Feel like a question is forming
And the answers
I will be what I could be
Once I get out of this town.

The lights of this city
They've lost all of their feeling
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone
Gone, going for it all, this time I'm gone

Nothing is everything
I'll have it all
If nothing is everything then I will have it all.
I'm gone.
I was doom riding on top a black horse
Whatever prize there was
I could only observe where the trouble starts
Where does it end?

I cannot be cured
Before it ends
I know life would be different if I held on (held on)
I know I could be something if I held on

Gave her love away
Put it in my pocket when it should've been framed
Oh, it lost its shine
Gotta get this out of my head

Out of my brain
How could it end,
End like this?
How could it end?

I know life would be different had I held on (held on)
I know I could be something had I held on (held on)
I know I could be something if I held on (held on)
I know life would be different if I held on (held on)

Held on
Held on, if I held on
Held on, if I held on
Held on, if I held on

Held on.

It's a disease and they're all green 
It emanates from their being 
A satiation with occupation 
And like weeds with big leaves
Stealing light from what's beneath
Where they have more 
Still they take more 
I know, then I don't 
There's a stow-away with my throat 
It's deceiving, I don't believe him 
We can scream out our doors
Behind the wall, a fat man snores 
In his dreams, he's choking ti leaves
Well I guess there's nothing wrong with what you say 
But don't sell me, "there can't be better ways" 
Tell the captain, "the boat's not safe, and we're drowning" 
Turns out he's the one making waves, waves, waves...
I said there's nothing wrong with what you say 
Believe me, I'm just asking you to sway 
No white or black, just grey
Can you feel this world with your heart and not your brain?
Brain...
(G-are-E-E-D)
(G-are-E-E-D)
I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Pissed on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things [Repeat x4]
Clearer [Repeat x2]
Once you, were in my rearviewmirror

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades, are raised, hey

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you [Repeat x3]
Rearviewmirror

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, oh yeah
How long must she stand
Before the ground, it gives way
To an endless fall
She can feel this
War on her face
Stars on her pillow
She's folding in darkness
Begging for slumber

I'm not blind
Can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye

I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming
Violently shakes
My body

Her son's slanted
Always giving her
The sideways eye
And empty chair where dad sits
How loud can silence get?
And mom, she reassures
To contain him
But it's becoming a lie

She tells herself
And everyone else
Father is risking
His life for our freedoms

I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye

I'm no frantic
I can feel it coming
Darling you'll save me
If you save yourself
Winded is the sailor...drifting by the storm... 
Wounded is the organ he left all...bloodied on the shore... 
Gorgeous was his savior  sees her...drowning in his wake... 
Daily taste the salt of her tears  but...a chance blamed fate... 
Little secrets tremors...turned to quake... 
The smallest oceans still get...big  big waves... 
Ransom paid the Devil...He whispers pleasing words... 
Triumphant are the angels if they can...a get there first... 
Little secrets tremors...turned to quake... 
The smallest oceans still get...big, big waves... 
I'll decide...take the dive... 
Take my time...not my life... 
Wait for signs...believe in lies... 
To get by...it's divine...whoa... 
Oh, you know what it's like... 
Turns the bow back, tows and...drops the line... 
Puts his faith and love in tremor Christ...
One, two, one, two, three, four...
Know a man...his face seemed pulled and tense...
Like he's riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds...
So I approach with tact...suggest that he should relax...
But he's always movin' much too fast...
Said he'll see me on the flipside
On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been takin' too much on...
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes
There he goes...
He's yet to come back...but I've seen his picture...
It doesn't look the same up on the racks...
We go way back...
I wonder 'bout his insides...
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size...
He's been taken...where, I don't know?
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope...
There he goes...
And now I rub my eyes...for he has returned...
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned...
For he still smiles...and he's still strong...
Nothing's changed, but the surrounding bullshit, that has grown...
And now he's home, and we're laughing, like we always did...
My same old, same old friend...
Until a quarter-to-ten...
I saw the strain creep in...
He seems distracted and I know just what is gonna happen next...
Before his first step...he is off again...
I don't mind all the guys dancing with my girl
That's fine, I know them all pretty well
And I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes, I know I gotta get away
Bells chime, I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright
The kids are alright

I know if I go things would be a lot better for her
I had this plan but her folks wouldn't let her
I don't mind, I feel i gotta get away
Bells chime, i know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't I'll go out of my fuckin' mind
Better leave her behind where the kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
Underneath this smile lies everything
All my hopes and anger, pride and shame
Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past
Just for today I am free

I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today

I know this one thing wellâ?¦

I used to try and kill love. the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in

Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all human light.

How I choose to feel is how I am.
How I choose to feel is how I am.

I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today
Holding on, the light of night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul
Again

Let me run into the rain
To be a human light again

Let me run into the rain
To shine a human light today

Life comes from within your heart and desire
Life comes from within my heart and desire
Life comes from within your heart and desire
One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five, against one
Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five...five, five...five against one

Torture from you to me
Abducted from the street

I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

Why would you wanna hurt me, oh
Oh, so frightened of your pain...yeah...ooh

I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

I'd rather be
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

I'd rather be
I'd rather be
I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal

Said one, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five...five, five...five against one
One, two, three, four, five against one
Five, five...five, five...five against one
He won the lottery, when he was born
Took his mother's white breast to his tongue
Trained like dogs, color and smell
Walks by me to get to him

Police man, police man

He won the lottery, by being born
Big hand slapped a white male American
Do no wrong, so clean cut
Dirty his hands, it comes right off

Police man, police man

Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man, police man

Jesus greets me, looks just like me

Do no wrong, so clean cut
Dirty his hands, it comes right off

Police man, police man, police man

Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man, police man

Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man, police man, police man

All my pieces set me free
All my pieces set me free
All my pieces set me free
All my pieces set me free

Human devices set me free
Human devices set me free
All my pieces set me free
All my pieces set me free

Human devices set me free
Human devices set me free
Don't feel like home 
Ease a little out 
And all these words alone is nothing like a poem 
Putting in, inputting in 
Don't feel like methadone 
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone 

It's nothing as it seems 
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

One uninvited chromosome
A blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes
Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding, rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home

And all that he frees
A little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see it's home
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left

And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
The next time we touch

You don't have to stray
The oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts

Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
I will be, I will be there once more


Why deny all the troubles when combined 
With the missing links it don't feel like home now 

That your gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum 
You're always wishing and never here at home 

You all the dreams we shared and 
Lights we turned on 
But the house is getting dark 

And I don't want to know your past 
But together share the dawn 
And I won't need nothing else 
Cause when we're dead 
We would've had it all and died 

I would've fallen from the sky til you 
Parachutes have opened now 

Heaven knows if there's a ceiling 
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that I got all the friends I'm needing
Before my light go out 
As the doors are closing now 

And far away will be my home 
And to grasp this, I don't know 
But I don't need 
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today 

And love 
Wish the world could glow again with love 
One can't see to have enough 

And war 
Break the sky and tell me what it's for 
I'll travel there on my own 

And love 
What a different life 
Had I not found this love with you
Routine was the theme 
He'd wake up, wash and pour himself into uniform
Something he hadn't imagined being 
As the merging traffic passed 
He found himself staring down 
At his own hands 
Not remembering the change 
Not recalling the plan 
Was it?... 

He was okay 
But wondering
About wandering 
Was it age? 
By consequence? 
Or was he moved sleight of hand? 

Mondays were made to fall 
Lost on a road he knew by heart 
It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly
Sometimes he hid in his radio
Watching others pull into their homes
While he was drifting 

On a line 
Of his own 
Off the line 
Off the side 
By the by 
As dirt turned to sand 
As if moved by sleight of hand 

When he reached the shore of his clip-on world 
He resurfaced to the norm 
Organized his few things, his coat and keys 
Any new realizations would have to wait 
Till he had more time 
More time 

A time to dream 
To himself 
He waves goodbye 
To himself 
I'll see you on the other side 
Another man moved by sleight of hand
It's not all been said...been said and done... 
I've never slept in Satan's bed 
Although I must admit...still visits my place
Uninvited  as you know  he don't wait 
Funny how he always seems to fit in 
Funny how I always want to give in 
Sundays Fridays Tuesdays Thursday  the same 
Sometimes the special guest  he don't like to leave
Already...in love... (3x) 
Already... 
Who made  who made up  made up the myth 
That we were born to be covered in bliss? 
Who set the standard, born to be rich? 
Such fine examples, skinny little bitch
Model, role model, roll some models in blood 
Get some flesh to stick, so they look like us 
I shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club 
I'd stop and talk, but I'm already in love 
Already...in love... (3x) 
Already... 
In love...Ah ha ha ha... 
...follows torture...follows reward... (2x) 
Oh, oh my butt... 
Never shook Satan's hand, look see for yourself 
You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off 
I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both 
Jump off a cliff, don't need your help so back off 
I'll never suck Satan's dick... 
Again, you'd see it, you know, right round the lips 
I'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath 
'Magine they're busy, think I'm doing okay... 
Already...in love... (6x) 
Already...
Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it, too

Small my table, sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from? 
Stormed my room
And you dare say it belongs to you, to you

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you ah, you

Scream my friends don't call me
Friends, they don't scream
My friends don't call my friends don't

All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedications, naive and true
With no power, nothing to do
I still remember, why don't you?
Don't you

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, never was for you, fuck you
This is not for you
Oh, this is not for you yeah, you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you
Oh, you
I have not been home since you left long ago
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Counting steps, walking backwards on the road
I'm counting my way back to heaven

I can't be free with what's locked inside of me
If there was a key, you took it in your hand
There's no wrong or right, but I'm sure there's good and bad
The questions linger overhead

No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
I wish that I could hold you
I wish that I had
Thinking 'bout heaven

I let go of a rope, thinking that's what held me back
And in time I've realized, it's now wrapped around my neck
I can't see what's next, from this lonely overpass
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past

All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives
Choosing the shiny ones instead
I turned my back, now there's no turning back

No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead
I smile, but who am I kidding?
I'm just walking the mile, every once in a while I'll get a ride
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
Thumbing my way back to heaven
I'm thumbing my way back to heaven
I want for to lay down, I'm waiting 'till sundown 
I'm searching the haystacks, water is sunshine, wait for the moment 
The moment between us, the fire is made now, harder to touch 
I wanted to get right 
I wanted to get right 
I wanted to get right with you
Bakers dozen parades, stand and debate 
Out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must 
Keeping your boots on, float with the now, hot to the touch
Concrete underground, cast out everyday, the dregs of society
Underbelly, inside of me, rejoice and follow thee 
I wanted to get right 
I wanted to get right 
I wanted to get right with it, with you 
With...you...
Yeah
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I shut and locked the front door 
No way in or out 
I turned and walked the hallways 
And pulled the curtains down 
yeah I knelt and emptied the mouths of every plug around 
But nothing's sound
nothing's sound 

I'd stay where my last step left me 
Ignored all my rounds 
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls 
They were upside down 

I swallow the truth to keep from lying 
I swallow my face just to keep from biting 
Yeah, I swallowed my breath, I went deep, 
I was diving, I was diving 
Yeah, I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened

[Repeat: x4]
I'm in hiding 

It's been about three days now 
Since I've been above ground 
i'm no longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now 
Yeah, it's funny how things change so much 
It's all state of mind 

I swallow the truth to keep from lying 
I swallow my face just to keep from biting. 
I, I am, I swallow my breath, I went deep, 
I was diving, I was diving 
Yeah, I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened

[Repeat x8]
Now I'm in hiding
How does he do it? how do they do it? uncanny and immutable
This is such a happening tailpipe of a party
Like sugar, the guests are so refined
A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?

He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer
Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike
Drilling for fear makes the job simple
Born on third, thinks he got a triple
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way
I remember when you sang that song about today

Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
A think tank of aloof multiplication
A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter
Retrenchment and hoggishness

The aristocrat choir sings, "what's the ruckus?"
The haves have not a clue
The immenseness of suffering
And the odd negotiation, a rarity

With onionskin plausibility of life
And a keyboard reaffirmation
Blackout weaves its way through the city
Blackout weaves its way through the city

Blackout weaves its way
I remember when you sang that song about today
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
I remember when you sang that song about today

Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed
Changed, changed, chains
Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better set a days, ooh yeah
Oh hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh yeah
Oh, dark grin he can't help when he's happy, looks insane, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away, yeah
Oh, someday, yeah, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneeling, looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Feeling
Oh, feeling understands the weather of the summers on it's way, yeah
Oh, ceilings few and far between all legal halls of shame

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away
Oh, someday yeah he'll begin his life again, yeah
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah, yeah

Oh even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away
Ah, someday yeah he'll begin his life again, yeah
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay 
Were laid spread out before me 
As her body once did 
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul 
As the earth to the sun 
Now the air I tasted and breathed 
Has taken a turn 

Oh and all I taught her was everything 
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore 
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds 
Of what was everything 
Oh the pictures have 
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything 
I take a walk outside 
I'm surrounded by 
Some kids at play 
I can feel their laughter 
So why do I sear 
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin 
Round my head 
I'm spinning 
Oh, I'm spinning 
How quick the sun can, drop away

And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass 
Of what was everything 
All the pictures had 
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything 
All the love gone bad 
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see 
All that I am 
All I'll be

Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life 
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky 
But why 
Why 
Why can't it be 
Why can't it be mine
I've got a feeling. A feeling deep inside oh yeah. Oh, yeah.
I've got a feeling. A feeling I can't hide oh no, no. Whoa, no.
Yeah. Yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.

Oh please believe me. I'd hate to miss the train oh yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, and if you leave me I won't be late again no no, no. Oh, no.
Yeah. I've got a feeling. Yeah whew ooh oh yeah.

And I don't understand how come nobody told me.
Why I'd want to sing like a Milli Vanilli?
All I ever wanted was someone who looked like you. You, oh.
I got a feeling that keeps me on my toes oh yeah yeah. Oh yeah.
Uh huh. I got a feeling. I think that everybody knows, oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.
Yeah, wow I got a feeling. Yeah, whoa.

Everybody had a good year though we never saw the sunshine.
Everybody had a wet dream. Making Temple was a good time.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Everybody made a movie. Everybody had one line.
Everybody misses Andy. We'll be seeing him in no time.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Oh, yeah. I got a feeling, yeah. Oh.
I got a feeling. A feeling deep inside oh yeah yeah. Oh yeah.
Oh, I got a feeling. A feeling I can't hide oh no no. Oh no.
Yeah, I got a feeling. yeah yeah ah ooh yeah.
I'm questioning my education
Is my education who I am now?
While you're deciding, I've been finding
Looking around in the here and now

If I've been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now by winning?
I'm questioning my own equation
Is my own equation relevant somehow?

The flags are waving, the news is breaking
See the man who can't pick out his own tie
If I've been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now be winning?

A wild world, figuring out the answers
I'll be in my own dance and iiii...
I'm questioning my education
Rewind and what does it show?

Could be, the truth it becomes you
I'm a seed, wondering why it grows...
Plaque on the wall says that no one's slept here 
It's rare to come upon a bridge that has not been around 
Or been stepped on 
Whatever the notions  we laced in our prayers 
The man upstairs is used to all of this noise 
I'm through with screaming 

And echoes nobody hears  it goes  it goes  it goes 
Like echoes nobody hears  it goes  it goes  it goes 
We're faithful  we all believe  we all believe it {4X} 

And echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes {2X} 
We're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it {3X} 
So faithful, we all believe, we all believe it 

M.Y.T.H. is? 
Belief in the game controls that keeps us in a box of fear 
We never listen
Voice inside so drowned out 
Drowned you are, you are, you are a furry thing 
And everything is you 
Me you, you me, it's all related 
What's a boy to do? 
Just be darling and I will be too 
Faithful to you
Do you want to hear something sad?
We are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

Bueno sera, I won't be long before we all walk off the wire
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require
Bueno sera I will come in quick
Don't want my flame to get no higher

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
Gonna see my friend, make it go away

Want to leave it all.
Want to give it up.
Want to see it go once and for all
Want to view it cho'
Want a little bit home
Want to be there

Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, ?
Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
But I'm gonna shake this day
I wanna shake this day before I retire

I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
I got you, and that's all I want
I won't forget 'cause that's a whole lot
When something's wrong I feel uneasy
You show me, tell me you're not teasin'

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying
Look at you, you're a pageant
You're everything, oh yeah, that I've imagined

I don't go out, now that you're here
Sometimes we shout, but that's no problem
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened 
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying 

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened 
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying
There's no doubt, but when I'm with you
When I'm without, I stay in my room

Where do you go? I get no answer
You're always out, it gets on my nerves...
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened 
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying 

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened 
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying 
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened 
You can see my eyes and tell that I'm not lying
Talk of circles and punching out 
Looking in  drawing circles down 
Falling up the south marking ground
Talking out of turn  drawing circles down 

Like Pilate I have a dog 
{Obeys listens kisses loves} 

Walks me out of town 
Still  one's a crowd
Making angels in the dirt 
Looking up  looking all around 

Like Pilate I have a dog 
{Obeys listens kisses loves} 

Stunned by my own reflection 
It's looking back, sees me too clearly 
And I swore I'd never go there again 
Not unlike a friend that politely drags you down, you down, you down 

Like Pilate, I have a dog 
{Obeys, listens, kisses, loves}
No, I won't back down
No, I won't back down 
You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down

I will stand my ground, won't be turned around
I will keep my world from draggin' me down, I won't back down
No, I won't back down

Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground
No, I won't back down

Oh, I know what's right, I got just one life
I will keep this world from pushin' me around, I'll stand my ground
No, I won't back down

Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground
Hey, I will stand my ground 
And I won't back down

And I won't back down, no I won't back down
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind

North is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in between is mine
I am mine

And the feeling it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

And the meaning it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significance between the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
What

And the feelings that gets left behind
All the innocent broken with lies
Significance, between the lines
(We may need to hide)

And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
Freezin'  rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh  Feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days
Oh  hand out  faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar
Oh  dark grin  he can't help when he's happy he looks insane

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh  he don't know
So he chases them away
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again
Life again
Kneelin'  looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way, yeah
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Woo
Oh yeah yeah

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Woo
Oh yeah yeah
Gonna save you fucker,.not gonna lose you
Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go,
Too important to me

Too important to us, we'd be lost without you
Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now

And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear
And fuck if you only hear what you want to hear
Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here

You helped me when I was down, I'll help when you're down
Why are you hitting yourself, c'mon hit me instead

Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy
I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now

And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfist and clear
And you're not leaving here without me, I don't want to be without
My best friend, wake up to see you could have it all

Cause there is but you, and something within you
It's taken control, let's beat it, get up let's go

Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world
Let's pick up your soul

And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear
And fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
Please help, me, to help you, help yourself

Help me help yourself, please want me to, please let me to

Help you
Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
Riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under the red dress I wish I could see
Further North the warmth of lovin' lingering
Now Johnny he be having lots of women
Oh the reason he'd be smiling known to him

On the left the girl in red so innocent
Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
Yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin
Can't help but wonder where and who she is
Oh and the memory's always getting clearer
First thirty years and more I've loved her so
But now I need to know why she's with him

And I sleep with the light on in case she comes
And I sleep with the light on in case she,

Recently as I was waiting on a dream
She came to visit lost and lonely me
Oh she leaned over the bed and with the lips above my head
She asked if I had seen her Johnny
Oh and I hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
Oh yeah I have been hoping that
When she came that she would come for me

Hey, hey,

I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
That when she came she'd be coming just for me,
I'll hide my disappointment cause for years I have been hoping
That when she came she'd be coming just for me,ah yeah!

Aw yeah!
Aw yeah!
Hoo
Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Oh

Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself, oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone

She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Yeah

She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again

Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun, arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember pickin' on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooo, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast

How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this
Try to erase this, from the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Drive down the street  can't find the keys to my own fucking home
I take a walk so I can curse my ass for being dumb
I make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone
Stop at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog
I've been goin' to Lukin's...I gotta spot that Lukin's...
I knocked the door at Lukin's...opened the fridge...
Now I know life is worth...
I find the key  but I return to find an open door
So fucking freezin', they jump out the car, everybody wants some
I find my wife, I call the cops, this day's work's never done
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun
I will light the match this mornin'  so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent  for soon light will be gone
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam
Oh I will make my way  through  one more day in, hell
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make  yeah

I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
Oh  I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
Oh  I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make, how much difference

I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
How much difference
How much difference does it make
Behind her eyes there's curtains
But they've been closed to hide the flames
Remains

She know's there future's burning
But she can smile just the same

And though her mood is fine today
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Standing like a statue
A chin of stone a heart of clay
Hey

And though he's to big a man to say
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away... 
Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...Drifting away...
Oh please don't go out on me  don't go out on me now
Never acted up before  don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted  just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you  just passing it on
Go, fuck

Once fastened servile  now your getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly  with such disarm
I pulled the covers over him  shoulda' pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis  a fool no fucking god
No, time, suck, my, please,
Don't go on me
Please

Suck, blood, touch, please, tunnel vision, tuck, time, see,
Please, please, please,
Don't go on me

Please, Don't you want me, don't go on me,
Please, don't go on me
I admit it, what's to say 
I'll relive it, without pain 
Backstreet lover on the side 
Of the road 
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode 
I got a .16 gauge buried
Under my clothes, I play

Once upon a time I could control myself 
Once upon a time I could lose myself 
Oh try and mimic, what's insane 
I am in it, where do I stand? 

Indian summer I hate the heat 
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat 
I got my hand in my pocket 
So determined
Discreet, I pray. 

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself 
Once upon a time I could control myself 
Once upon a time I could lose myself 
Once upon a time I could love myself 
Once upon a time I could love you
Once 
Once 
Once
Once
Once
Once 
Yeah yeah
Don't it make you smile? (2x)
When the sun don't shine  it don't shine at all...
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make me smile? Yeah...
When the sun don't shine it don't shine at all...yeah...
Don't it make me smile?
I miss you already yeah...I miss you always...
I miss you already yeah...I miss you all day...
This is how I feel...
I...I miss you already  yeah...I miss you always...
The crooked heart swells all around, yeah...I miss you all day...
The crooked heart swells around, yeah...
Don't it make you smile? (2x)
The crooked heart swells around...
See this needle
Oh see my hand 
Drop, drop, dropping it down
oh  so gently 
here it comes
touch the flame
Turn me up
won't turn you away 

Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin
spin the black, spin the black 
Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin
whoa 

Pull it out
a paper sleeve
Oh my joy
only you deserve conceit
Oh I'm so big
and my whole world 
I'd rather you
rather you, than her 

Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin
spin the black, spin the black 
Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin
whoa 

Oh you're so warm
oh, the ritual
as I lay down your crooked arm

Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin
spin the black, spin the black 
Spin, spin
spin the black circle 
Spin, spin

[Repeat: x5]
Spin the black
circle 

Spin the black circle
Spin the black circle
I seem to recognize your face
Haunting, familiar yet, I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me

All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

I swear, I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf

I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream hello

Well, my God it's been too long
Never dreamed You'd return
But now here You are and here I am

Hearts and thoughts they fade away

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Fade away, fade away
There I was, laid out on a table
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin'
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore
In my sight, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
"Son," she said, "Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him but I'm glad we talked"

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
"I can't remember anything to this very day 'cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare"

I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

"Is something wrong?", she said
Well of course there is, "you're still alive," she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question? And if so, if so, who answers, who answers?

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I took a drive today. Time to emancipate.
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise.
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize.

I couldn't breathe. Holding me down.
Hand on my face. Pushed to the ground.
Enmity gauged. United by fear.
Forced to endure what I could not forgive.

I seem to look away. The wounds in the mirror waved.
It wasn't my surface. Most defiled.

Head at your feet. Fool to your crown.
Fist on my plate. Swallowed it down.
Enmity gauged. United by fear.
Tried to endure what I could not forgive. Yeah.

Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Clearer
Clearer
Oh, once you were in my Rearview mirror.
I gathered speed from you fucking with me.
Once and for all I'm far away.
Hard to believe. Finally the shades are raised. Hey, yea.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you
Rearview mirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you
Rearviewmirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you
Rearviewmirror.
Saw things so much clearer once you
Oh yeah.
Here far away
One could feel the earth vibrate
Moon changing shape and shade
As we all do under its gaze
Yellow moon on the rise
Yellow moon on the rise

Round we go, where we stop no one knows
So tonight the moon I go
Yellow moon on the rise

An echo that rings a bullet unchained
One life, one grave joins the parade

At night the sky grows dark with fallen stars
Who comes so far a headstone and grave
The colors turns grey, the black and white fades
Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise

Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise
Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violence, center of her own attention
The  mother reads aloud child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud

The shades go down  it's in her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me

Don't call me,
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will, rise above

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughters

The shades go down
The shades go, go, go
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh

You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more

Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Do you see the way that tree bends? Does it inspire? 
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays...a lesson to be applied... 
Are you gettin' something out of this all encompassing trip? 
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets  oh... 
Or you can come to terms and realize 
You're the only one who can forgive yourself  oh yeah... 
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense... 
Have you ideas on how this life ends? 
Checked your hands and studied the lines? 
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light? 
Seems that needlessly it's gettin' harder 
To find an approach and a way to live... 
Are we gettin' something out of this all-encompassing trip? 
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh... 
Or you can come to terms and realize... 
You're the only one who cannot forgive yourself, oh... 
A-makes much more sense to live in the present tense...
All the photographs are peeling
And colors turn to gray, he's stayin'
In his room with memories for days, he faced
An undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced
By the loss of one he could not replace
And there's no reason that she'd pass
And there is no god with the plan, it's sad
And his holiness is proof, it's sad
He could only love you, it's sad
The door swings through a passing fable
A fate we may delay, we say
Holding on, to live within our embrace
Eleven nights, he laid in bed
Hoping that dreams would bring her back, it's sad
And his holiness is proof, it's sad
He could only love you, it's sad
Holding his last breath, believing
He'll make his way
But she's not forgotten
He's haunted
He's searching for escape
If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent
And his holiness is proof, it's sad
He will always love you, it's sad
Watched from the window with a red mosquito... 
I was not allowed to leave the room... 
I saw the sun go down  and now it's comin' up... 
Somewhere in the time between... 
I was bitten...must have been the devil... 
He was just payin' me... 
A little visit  a reminding me of his presence... 
Lettin' me know...he's a waitin' for me... 
Red man's your neighbor  call it behavior... 
While you're climbing up slippery hills... 
Two steps ahead of him, punctures in your neck... 
Hoverin' just above your bed... (2x) 
I was bitten...must have been the devil... 
He was just paying me... 
A little visit, reminding me of his presence... 
And lettin' me know...he's a-waitin'...he's a-waitin'... 
Up there...yeah... 
If I had known then what I now know... (4x)
Don't need a helmet got a hard hard head
Don't need a raincoat I'm already wet 
Don't need a bandage there's too much blood
After a while seems to roll right off hmm  

Whipping ah they're whipping ah  
They're whipping ah they're whipping  

Don't need a hand there's always arms attached 
Oh don't get behind I can't fall back 
Why must we trust all these rusted rails? 
They don't want no change, we already have 

They're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping  

Don't mean to push, but I'm being shoved! 
Oh, I'm just like you, think we've had enough 
I can't believe a thing they want us to oh  
Oh, we all got scars, they should have 'em too  

Oh, they're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping  
They're whipping, ah they're whipping, ah  
They're whipping yeah they're whipping
I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar  yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place  I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade  fade away

I swear I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me  you wouldn't recall, for I'm not my former
It's hard when, your stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream, hello
My god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade
I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I've deciphered tricks at the bar
But now your gone
I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles
And jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what there for
I've understood feelings
And I've understood words
But how could you be taken away

And wherever you've gone
And where ever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your lights reflected now
Reflected from a far
We were but stones
Your light made us stars

With heavy breath
Awakens regrets
Back pages and days alone the could've been spent
Together but we were miles apart
Every inch between becomes light years now
No time to be void
Or save up on life
Uh you've got to spend it all

And wherever you've gone
And where ever we might go
It don't seem fair
You seem to like it here
Your lights reflected now
Reflected from a far
We were but stones
Your light made us stars

And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your lights reflected now
Reflected from a far
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
Repeat till end
I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize
I couldn't breathe
Holding me down

Hand on my face
Pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive
I seem to look away

The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled
Head at your feet
Fool to your crown
Fist on my plate
Swallowed it down
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive
Yeah

[Repeat: x4]
Saw things

[Repeat: x2]
Clearer

Oh, once you were in my rear view mirror
I gathered speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
Hard to believe
Finally the shades are raised
Hey, yeah

Saw things so much clearer once you, once you, rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you, rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer once you, once you, rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer once you
Oh yeah
Large fingers pushin' paint... 
You're God and you got big hands... 
The colors blend... 
The challenges you give man... 
Seek my part...devote myself... 
My small self...like a book amongst the many on a shelf... 
Sometimes I know  sometimes I rise 
Sometimes I fall  sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I cringe sometimes I live 
Sometimes I walk  sometimes I kneel
Sometimes I speak of nothing at all... 
Sometimes I reach to myself, hear God...
It's out of my hands, making all hands meet
Stumble as it's crumbling out of reach
It's in the cards of destiny
Your sanity in tow
Designate my luck
Resignate

This power has no roots to guide, no role
Trust me, rusted minds refuse to go
Unwillingness, it's meaningless
To walk away in vain
Designate my will
Designate my will
Resignate

My will is crashing, synapses flashing slow
Days like frame by frame, where do they go'
Yeah, why fight' forget it
Can't I spend it after I go'

Roll them high
Throw them again
All Gods' dice

Monkey driven, call this living, ha ha ha
Too much thought, it's overwrought, a hole
Minding yours, what's mine, not yours
Will finish us off
Designate my life
Designate a view
Designate my will, my will, my will, I will
Resignate my god
Don't even think about reachin' me, I won't be home 
Don't even think about stoppin' by, don't think of me at all 
I did, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you

Aah...don't even think about gettin' inside
Voices in me head, ooh, voices 
I got scratches, all over my arms 
One for each day, since I fell apart 
I did...oh, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you 

Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you, oh
Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you 

Hey...I did, what I had to do, oh, and if there was a reason 
Oh, there wasn't no reason, no 
And if, there's something you'd like to do 
Just let me continue, to blame you 

Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you, oh 
Pictures on my chest, it was you, you, oh
Got a gun  fact I got two 
That's O.K. man 'cause I love god 
Glorified version of a pellet gun 
Feels so manly when armed
Glorified version of a pellet gun 

Double think dumb is strength
Never shot at a living thing
Glorified version of a pellet gun 
Feels so manly when armed
Glorified version of a pellet gun 
Glorified version of a

Always keep it loaded
Kindred to be an American
Life comes, I can feel your heart,  
Ooh, life comes, I can feel your heart through your neck,  
Life comes, I can feel your heart through your neck,  
Life comes, I can steal your heart form your neck,  

Glorified, glorified
Everyone’s a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody is thinking they can all be delivered sitting in a box like lost and found

But I found my place and it’s all right
We’re all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate
It’s all right, I got my own way to believe

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle all alone and sinking the bow

And if you want to have to pray, it’s all right
We all be thinking with our different brain get this off my plate
It’s all right, I got my own way to believe, it’s okay

Sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now, make your getaway
Science says we’re making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain’t profound
Silence says we’re not allowed to consider
Silence says stand up sit down you’re out

But I found my place
And it’s all right, I’m bearing witness to some better things, get this off my plate
It’s all right, I’ve got my own way to believe
It’s okay, sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There’s no way, mine is mine and yours won’t take its place, now make your getaway

It’s okay, sometimes you find yourself having to put all your faith in no faith
Mine is mine and yours won’t take its place
Now make your getaway, it’s okay
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
For god’s sake, mine is mine and yours won’t take its place

Now, make your getaway
Now, make your getaway
Woo
I'm ahead, I'm a man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in god I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby

I'm at piece, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby

I'm a thief, I'm a liar
There's my church, I sing in the choir:
(Hallelujah, hallelujah)

Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, admire my clones
'Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
Nothin', why? 
Because it's evolution, baby! 

I am ahead, I am advanced
I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher
2010, watch it go to fire
It's evolution, baby
Do the evolution
Come on, come on, come on
He could've tuned in  tuned in
But he tuned out
A bad time nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out
He got up outta there  ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean  had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up  set him down on his knee

A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings  "Hey  look at me now"
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh power oh

He's flying
Whole
High wide, oh

He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well, fuckers
He still stands

And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly

High flying
Oh, oh
High flying
Oh, oh
He's flying
Oh, oh
All the thoughts you never see
You are always thinking
Brain is wide, the brain is deep
Oh, are you sinking?

Feel the path of every day
Which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay
Yeah, this is living

Look for love in evidence
That you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives
It's so sad and sickening

Feel the air up above
Oh, pool of blue sky
Fill the air up with love
All black with starlight

Feel the sky blanket you
With gems and rhinestones
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on

For you to walk on

Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here,
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing left,
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here

See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores
Awaiting your arrival
Dream the dreams of other men
You'll be no one's rival
Dream the dreams of others then
You will be no one's rival

You will be no one's rival

A distant time, a distant space
That's where we're living
A distant time, a distant place
So what ya giving?
What ya giving?
You're always saying that there's something wrong. 
I'm starting to believe it's you're playing along. 
Death came around, forced to hear it's song 
And know tomorrow can't be depended on 

Seen the home inside your head. 
Unlocked doors and unmade beds 

Open sores unattended 
Let me say just once that 

I have faced it, a life wasted. 
I'm never going back again. 
I escaped it,a life wasted. 
I'm never going back again. 
Having tasted, a life wasted. 
I'm never going back again. 

The world awaits just up the stairs
Leave the pain for someone else 
Nothing back there for you to find 
Or was it you you left behind 

You're always saying you're too weak to be Strong. 
You're harder on yourself than just about Anyone 

Why swim the channel just to get this far? 
Halfway there, why would you turn around? 

Darkness comes in waves...tell me, 
Why invite it to stay? 

You're one with negativity 
Yes, comfort is an energy 
But why let the sad song play? 

I have faced it, a life wasted 
I'm never going back again 

Oh I escaped it, a life wasted 
I'm never going back again
Having tasted, a life wasted 
I'm never going back again 

Oh I erased it, a life wasted 
I'm never going back again
Sometimes there's no star shining
Scouting the edge of the universe
Sometimes you can't see the horizon 
Ah, between the ocean and the earth 

And just when you're thinking about slinkin' down 
I'm gonna pull you up 
I'm gonna pull ya round 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

And you say living ain't nothing but hassles 
In a manila envelope rain 
And driving coal all night to Newcastle 
It's getting to be a repetitive strain 
And just when you're thinking about
Going down the drain 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

I'm gonna pull you up
I'm gonna pull ya round 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

They say the stars, they can't see their rays 
Nor can they count their numbered days 
No flower can say what perfume is 
We got all that and burnin' dead 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

May I remind you of that scene
Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better, set a days, ooh yeah
Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar,
Oh yeah
Oh, dark grin, he can't help, when he's happy looks insane, oh yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneelin', looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather of the winters on its way
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Yeah!
Woo, ah yeah, fuck it up

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Yeah!
Woo, uh huh, yeah, yeah, fuck em up again
The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lay alone just like before

I take the poor man's path I must refuse your test
Push me and I will resist
This behaviours not unique
I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it of in blood let, I be wed

I'm already cut up an half dead
I'll end up alone like I began
Everything has chains absolutely nothings changed
Take my hand not my picture spill my tincture

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't be what you want because I'm

I ain't supposed to be just fun
Oh to live and die let it be done
I figure I'll be dammed
All alone like I began
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me 
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me 
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me 
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me 
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y
P-R-I-V-A-C-Y
What were all those dreams we shared
Those many years ago?
What were all those plans we made now
Left beside the road?
Behind us in the road

More than friends, I always pledged
Cause friends they come and go
People change, as does everything
I wanted to grow old
I just want to grow old

Slide up next to me
I'm just a human being
I will take the blame
But just the same
This is not me

You see?
Believe

I'm better than this
Don't leave me so cold
I'm buried beneath the stones
I just want to hold on
I know I'm worth your love

Enough
I don't think
There's such a thing

It's my fault now
Having caught a sickness in my bones
How it pains to leave you here
With the kids on your own
Just don't let me go

Help me see myself
Cause I can no longer tell
Looking out from the inside
Of the bottom of a well

It's hell
I yell

But no one hears before I disappear
Whisper in my ear
Give me something to echo
In my unknown future's ear

My dear
The end
Comes near
I'm here
But not much longer.
Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Oh, that red, white 'n blue
And when they play "Hail to the Chief"
Oh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born, silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves?
And when the tax man knocks on their door
Oh, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no

Some folks are born
Star-spangled eyes
Oh, they send you out to war
And when Australia asks:
"How much do we get?"
Oh, they just ask for more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and...

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaires son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one, one
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no CIA son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son, son, son
You'll be...going out with radio... 
Going out with disco...going out like bacchanal... 
I'll be...going out with telephone... 
Going out alone...to the radar zone... 
It's all just inadvertent imitation  and I don't mean mine 
It's all across this nation... 
If it's just inadvertent simulation  a pattern in all mankind 
What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
I'll be...playing with my magazine... 
Using up my Listerine...Like Ovaltine... 
And you'll be...you're dippin' in your battleship... 
For the latest tip...for the latest dream... 
It's all just inadvertent, imitation, and I don't mean mine 
It's all across this nation... 
If it's just inadvertent, simulation, a pattern in all mankind 
What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
If it's just inadvertent, imitation, a pattern in all mankind 
What's got the whole world fakin' it? 
What's got the whole world fakin'? (4x) 
What's got the whole world fakin' it, yeah?
Come to send  not condescend
Transcendental consequences to transcend... 
Where we are...Who are we? Who we are... 
Trampled moss on your souls... 
Changes all  you're a part... 
Seen it all  not at all... 
Can't defend the command... 
Take me a for a ride before we leave... 
Circumstance clappin' hands... 
A driving winds happenstance... 
Off the track  in the mud... 
That's the moss in the aforementioned verse... 
...miraculous...and a little... 
Just a little time, before we leave... 
Stoplight plays its part... 
So I would say you've got a part... 
What's your part? Who you are 
You are who, who you are...
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No prints left at the crime

Our ship's come in and it's sinking

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Somehow it is the biggest things
that keep on slipping right through our hands

By thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead
Ah, time we best begin here at the end, end

Wanna third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance
All good things come to an end
This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence?

You think we've been here before
You are mistaken

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
When progress could be plausible
In reverse we curse ourselves yeah

Oh yeah by thinking we're infallible
Oh we are tempting fate instead uh uh uh
Time we best begin here at the end, end

Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man
Ye yeah somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands

Hey by thinking we're infallible
Oh, we are tempting fate instead
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah

Oh time we best begin
Here at the end, end
Here at the end, end

Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
The sirens scream wanton attention 
Time to take heed and change directions 
Time to take stock and make omissions
Evacuation
Evacuation 

Time to take leave all formal functions 
Time to plant seeds of reconstruction 
No time this time to feign reluctance 

It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way 
Bets put aside, you're evil, let's crawl into your face 
A vision, vague or not, raising a frightful wake-you-up 

Time for evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation

There was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear in the sand 
Altered by a fallen eagle, a warning sign 
He sensed worry could be strength, with a plan said time for 

Evacuation

Evacuation, evacuation
Evacuation, evacuation
Evacuation, evacuation
Evacuation, evacuation
Evacuation, evacuation
Evacuation, evacuation
The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lay alone just like before

I take the poor man's path I must refuse your test
Push me and I will resist
This behaviours not unique
I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it of in blood let, I be wed

I'm already cut up an half dead
I'll end up alone like I began
Everything has chains absolutely nothings changed
Take my hand not my picture spill my tincture

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't buy what I want because its free
Can't be what you want because I'm

I ain't supposed to be just fun
Oh to live and die let it be done
I figure I'll be dammed
All alone like I began
They're buildin' the gallows outside my cell.
I got 25 minutes to go.

And in 25 minutes I'll be in Hell.
I got 24 minutes to go.

Well, they give me some beans for my last meal.
23 minutes to go.

And you know... nobody asked me how I feel.
I got 22 minutes to go.

So, I wrote to the Gov'nor... the whole damned bunch.
Ahhh... 21 minutes to go.

And I call up the Mayor, and he's out to lunch.

I got 20 more minutes to go.

Well, the Sheriff says, "Boy, I wanna watch you die".
19 minutes to go.

I spit in his face... and I kicked him in the eye.
I got 18 minutes to go.

Well...I call out to the Warden to hear my plea.
17 minute to go.

He says, "Call me back in a week or three.
You've got 16 minutes to go."

Well, my lawyer says he's sorry he missed my case.
Mmmm....15 minutes to go.

Yeah, well if you're so sorry, come up and take my place.
I got 14 minutes to go.

Well, now here comes the padre to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go.

And he's talkin' about burnin', but I'm so damned cold.
I got 12 more minutes to go.

Now they're testin' the trap. It chills my spine.
I got 11 minutes to go.

'cause the goddamned thing it works just fine.
I got 10 more minutes to go.

I'm waitin' for the pardon... gonna set me free
With 9 more minutes to go.

But this ain't the movies, so to hell with me.
I got 8 more minutes to go.

And now I'm climbin up the ladder with a scaffold peg
With 7 more minutes to go.

I've betta' watch my step or else I'll break my leg.
I got 6 more minutes to go.

Yeah... with my feet on the trap and my head in the noose...
5 more minutes to go.

Well, c'mon somethin' and cut me loose.
I got 4 more minutes to go.

I can see the mountains. I see the sky.
3 more minutes to go.

And it's too damned pretty for a man to die.
I got 2 more minutes to go

I can hear the buzzards... hear the crows.
1 more minute to go.

And now I'm swingin' and here I gooooooooo....




I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Pissed on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things [Repeat x4]
Clearer [Repeat x2]
Once you, were in my rearviewmirror

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades, are raised, hey

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you [Repeat x3]
Rearviewmirror

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, oh yeah
There's a girl on a ledge she's got nowhere to turn,
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned,
Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern,
She can blame the world or prey till dawn

But only love can break her fall,
Break her fall,
Yeah, only love can break her fall, fall.

It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth,
And she's standing outside hating everyone here,
Yeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll,

But only love can break her fall,
Break her fall,
Only love can break her fall. Yeah.

Yeah fall, the world is her fall, break her fall,
Love, love, love can break her fall,
Now only love can break her fall,
Love, love, love can break her fall, fall,
Love, love can break her fall,
Only love can break her.
Hey, oh
Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did
All five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn

Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by
Some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
Round my head
I'm spinning
Oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away

And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures had
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am
All I'll be

Yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be
Why can't it be mine
Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it, too

Small my table, sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from? 
Stormed my room
And you dare say it belongs to you, to you

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you ah, you

Scream my friends don't call me
Friends, they don't scream
My friends don't call my friends don't

All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedications, naive and true
With no power, nothing to do
I still remember, why don't you?
Don't you

This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, never was for you, fuck you
This is not for you
Oh, this is not for you yeah, you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you
Oh, you
I see the world
Feel the chill
Which way to go
Windowsill

I see the words
On a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain

Oh dear dad
Can you see me now
I am myself
Like you somehow

I'll ride the wave
Where it takes me
I'll hold the pain
Release it

Oh dear dad
Can you see me now
I am myself
Like you somehow

I'll wait up in the dark
For you to speak to me
I'll open up
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
Last stop on the westcoast line
South of the northern border
One small corner on my mind
Everybody, they know me there

Don't get any second glances
Chances are that they don't care
The world has come undone
Like to change it everyday
Change don't come at once
It's a wave building before it breaks
Can't wait for election day
Witness the occupation
Corporations rule the day
Well you know the pendulum throws
Farther out to the one side, swinging
Has to sweep back the other way

The world has come undone
Another day and who can wait
Change don't come at once
It's a wave building before it breaks

All this hope and nowhere to go
This is how I used to feel, but no more
The world has come undone
Like a game that few can play

Change don't come from one
It's a wave building before it breaks.
Light green to green, dark green, brown
Every life is falling down
Brown to black, it's coming back
Dies to be part of the ground
Seed to seedling, root to stem

Eyes, no eyes, there's no difference,
Every life is looking in
Swallowing seeds on the deathbed,
Dig a hole in, the garden.

Everyone is practicing,
But this world's an accident.
I was the fool because I thought

I thought the world
Turns out the world thought me
It's all the other way round
We're upside down

Daddy's gone up flames,
But this ain't no movie
This ain't no book you can close
When the big lie hits your eye.

Everybody's practicing,
Our world's an accident
I was the fool because I thought

Let the fluency set it down.
There's an upside of down.

The moon is rolling around.
Hear the sirens, hear the sirens
Hear the sirens, hear the circus all go found
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bend

Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
This light is pit, alive and I can see you clear
I could take your hand, and feel your breath
For feel that someday this will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose

Knowing that, nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
A distant laughter, with the ever after
But, all things change, let this remain

Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound, echoing closer, will they come for me, next time?

For every choice, mistake I made, is not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

It’s a fragile thing, this life we lead,
If I think too much, I can’t get over
When by the grace, by which we live
Our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go,
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

It’s a fragile thing, this life we lead,
If I think too much, I can’t get over
When by the grace, by which we live
Our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go,
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away,
The fear goes away, the fear goes away
Every night with the lights out, where you gone? 
What's wrong?  Ah
Every time you can try, but can't turn on, your rock song

got some if you need it, 
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it, 
I got some if you need it

Turn it up, turn it up
before it's gone, 
let's everybody carry on, carry on
Turn it up, turn it up,
before its gone, 
let's everybody get it on, get it on

precipitation, which side are you on? 
Are you on the rise, are you falling down?
Let me know, c'mon let's go.  Yeah

got some if you need it, 
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it, 
I got some if you need it

Turn it up, turn it up,
before we're gone,
let's everybody carry on, carry on 
Turn it up, turn it up,
before its gone, 
let's everybody get it on, get it on

Get it now, get enough, 
before its gone, 
let's everybody carry on, carry on
Turn it up, set it off, 
before its gone, 
let's everybody carry on, carry on

This situation, which side are you on? 
Are you getting out or are you dropping bombs?
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve? Yeah

Precipitation, which side are you on? 
Are you trying hard, are you on the rise?
Let me know, c'mon let's go. Yeah

got some if you need it
I got some, oh, oh

Turn it up, turn it up,
before its gone, 
let's everybody carry on, carry on
Turn it up, turn it up, 
before its gone, 
let's everybody get it on, get it on

This situation, which side are you on? 
Are you getting out, are you dropping bombs? 
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve? Yeah

Precipitation, which side are you on? 
Are you getting out, are you a big dropped bomb?
Are you a puddle full of detriment?  Oh

Got some, I got some
Carry on, carry on
got some if you need it, 
I got some if you need it
Carry on, let's go
You guys ready,
Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violins, center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

She holds the hand that holds her down
She will, rise above,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go, go, go
Wise men say, "Only fools rush in."
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Until I stay. Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you.
Like a river flows surely to the sea.
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be.

Oh take my hand. Take my whole life too.
Because I can't help falling in love with you.
And I can't help falling in love with you.
Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now?
Oh, it's sound insurance
But I can tell you, this is no lie

The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieving

You, you've been taught
We'd been the same, now they got you in line
Stand behind the stripes
There will be order, so give it a good mind

The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieving

And by name
The name they gave me
The name I'm letting go

The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieving
The whole world will be different soon, soon
Unsealed
On a porch a letter sat
Then you said I want to leave it again

Once I saw him
On a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I want to leave it again

On a weekend want to wish it all way
And they called an I said an I want what
I said an I call out again

And the reason oughta leave her calm I know
I said I know what I wear that a box or the bag

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay

Make me cry

I see
I don't know there's something else
I want to drum it all away
An I said
I said  "I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I'm sick and tired of hearing things,
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,
All I want is the truth,
Just gimme some truth,
I've had enough of reading things,
By neurotic, psychotic, pig headed politicians,
All I want is the truth,
Just give us the truth,

No short haired, yellow bellied, son of tricky Dicky is
Gonna mother hubbard, soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,
Money for oil,
Money for oil.

I'm sick to death of seeing things,
By tight lipped, condescending, mommy's little chauvinists,
All I want is the truth,
Just gimme some truth,
I've had enough of watching scenes,
Of schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoia prima donnas,
All I want is the truth,
Just give us the truth,

No short haired, yellow bellied, son of tricky Dicky is
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,
Money for oil,
Money for oil,

No short haired, yellow bellied, son of George-Porgy is
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,
It's money for oil,
No blood for oil,

I'm sick to death of hearing things,
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,
All I want is the truth,
Just gimme some truth,
I've had enough of reading things,
By neurotic psychotic, homophobic hypocrites,
All I want is the truth,
Just give us the truth,
All we want is the truth,
Just give us the truth,
We can handle the truth,
Just give us some truth,
Share with us the truth,
We'll give you our truth
Don't even think about reachin' me, I won't be home
Don't even think about stoppin' by, don't think of me at all
I did, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you...

Aah...don't even think about gettin' inside
Voices in me head...ooh, voices
I got scratches, all over my arms
One for each day, since I fell apart
I did...oh, what I had to do, if there was a reason, it was you

Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you...oh...
Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you...

Hey...I did, what I had to do...oh, and if there was a reason
Oh, there wasn't no reason, no
And if, there's something you'd like to do
Just let me continue, to blame you

Footsteps in the hall, it was you, you...oh...
Pictures on my chest, it was you, you...oh...
Sometimes I'm right then I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my songs
A butcher, a banker, Jack Irons on drums
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people

Then it's the blue ones who can't accept
The green ones for living with
The black ones tryin' to be a skinny one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby

Ooh sha sha
We gotta live together

I am no better and neither are you
We're all the same whatever we do
You love me you hate me
You know me and then
Still can't figure out the scene I'm in
I am everyday people

Then it's the new man
That doesn't like the short man
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby

Ooh sha sha
We got to live together
There is a yellow one that won't
Accept the black one
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one

Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and
Scooby dooby dooby
Ooh sha sha
I am everyday people
Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Oh

Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself, oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone

She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Yeah

She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again

Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
You should be happy with what you got, 
You should be hard to be a brother, 
You should be happy with what we give you

Hand over my face. 
I am related to my enemy.
My house on fire,
And my big brother come put the blame on me.

He's a-pushin', I'm being pushed from above.
Oh, and a brother, back to back to back,
Better back off of him.

You should not question at all his authority

Use a flag as a bandage.
Stick 'em up, show us your pocket hypocrisy.
In the closet, my pleasures
'Cause my big brother don't want to just let me be

Oh, and I'm pushin', oh if I could get above, 
Oh, and a brother back to back back,
Keep your back off.
Oh, and I'm pushin', I'm being pushed from above.
Oh, and a brother, back to back to back,
Better back off of him

Face down, brother, 
Face down [Repeat: x3]

In my mind there's a clearing.
Black clouds flow through gray still skies.
And the birds don't even whisper.
I'm flying out, I'm flying, 

Back to back back, better back off, 
Back to back to back, a better, better, better, 
Back to back to back, back to back back, brother, 
Face down, brother, 
Face down, 
Face down, brother, 
Face down, almost, fired, 
Face down, I got a gun, 
Face down, 
I got a gun, I got a gun, 
Face down, I got a gun, 
Face down

Fuck it, I'm just gonna go home, turn on the fuckin' TV, 
Watch the nightly news and drink a beer, 
Like I could even change the world, yeah right
I don't need anyone, don't need no mom and dad
Don't need no good advice, don't need no human rights
I got some news for you, don't even need you too
I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Got a sonic reducer, sonic reducer...

People out on the streets, they don't know who I am
I watch them from my room, they are just passing by
I'm not just anyone, said I'm not just anyone
I got my time machine, got my little 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...ahhh...

I'll be your bearer soon, love on some cotton doom
Things will be different then, the sun will rise from here
Then I'll be ten feet tall, then you'll be nothing at all
I got my time machine, got my 'lectronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...oh...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer...yeah...
Sonic reducer, sonic reducer, sonic reducer...oh...
I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize

I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled

Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things
Clearer, clearer
Once you, were in my rear view mirror

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all, I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades
Are raised, hey

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
(Rear view mirror)
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
(Rear view mirror)

Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
(Rear view mirror)
Saw things so much clearer
Once you
Oh yeah
How good is he?
How warm are his eyes
You'll see it's not a reprise
Did he arrive

Too late and too tethered away
To put on his suit and his tie?
How good is he?
How warm is his heart

Or ego telling him which place to park
Did he relate, the message is clearly hardly
Grounds for dismissal outright
Grounds for dismissal outright

I wake up and wait up
When anger's in fashion
I wake up and wait up
It echoes through the mansions

I wake up and wait up
When April's in may, oh uh oh
I wake up and wait up
The answers are fatal

The answers are fatal
When I wait up and wake up
The answers are fatal
If he's truly out of sight

Is he truly out of mind?
If he's truly out of sight..
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
All of the time
Wish you could help me mister
Wish you could lift me up
Wish you could pack my parachute mister
Wish you could pull me up
The winds of change...I'm stuck beneath the rain
I wish you could help me up
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Once inside, I'm out of my mind out
Out of my mind
Out of my mind yeah
Once inside, I'm out of my mind
Wish you could help me...give me a pill
A-just a little drink that I could swill
A little something anything anything, I'll try it all
I ain't got nowhere to go from here
I'm just about this far from drowning in my very own tears
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Once inside, I'm out of my mind yeah
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
I don't feel so fine
Out of my mind
Where do I go...where do I stay
I got no place to lay on the hay
Where do I go to soothe my head
Guess I'll turn on music instead
Where do I see...where do I shine
No one wants to take my mind
Where do I go...how do I feel
Guess I'll waste away in here
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind every single time.
On the edge
A windowsill
Ponders his maker
Ponders his will
To the street below
He just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view

And he sinks the needle deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom oh

On the edge
Of a know-nothin' town
Feelin' quite superior
The aged come
To the sky above
He just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view

And he sinks the burning knife deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep

On the edge of a
Christmas clean lover
Young virgin here from heaven
Visiting, yeah
To the man above her
She just ain't nothin'
She doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view

But he sinks himself deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
Can't touch the bottom
Deep, yeah

Can't touch the bottom

Can't touch the bottom
The bottom
I will light a match this morning
So I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon light will be gone
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched
Pretend I'm free to roam
Oh, I will make my way through
One more day in hell

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I will hold the candle
Until it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep taking punches
Until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down
Until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I'll swallow poison
Until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out
Till it fills this room

How much difference
How much difference
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
I seem to recognize your face
Haunting, familiar yet, I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me

All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

I swear, I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf

I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream hello

Well, my God it's been too long
Never dreamed You'd return
But now here You are and here I am

Hearts and thoughts they fade away

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Tried to remember but my feelings get old for sure
Tried to recall but it's gone
Lucky stars in your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know how I came here
I really don't know why I'm staying here
I'm walking the cow

Tried to point my finger but the wind keeps blowin' me around
In circles, in circles
Lucky stars in your eyes
I'm walking the cow

I really don't know what I have to fear
I really don't know why I have to care
I'm walking the cow

Lucky stars in your eyes...

She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday
Another child
Won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years
And counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend
She could join the game
She could be another clone
Why go home?

What you taught me
Don't come visit
Put me here
Mommy dear
Consider me an object
Put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions
Free of air and friction
Yea, I'll be hanging upside down.
And there I will swing
For all eternity
Fell it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling
Consider me an abscess
Leave me in my vacuum
Blood on all the pistons
Running my transmission
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling
Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling
Feel It rising
High above I'll break the law,
If it's illegal to be in love,
Leave the hatred, on the cross
Yea I'll be hanging upside down and here I will swing
For all eternity
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling
Feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling
Feel it rising, yea, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Something never thought you'd be part of...
Lyrics
Oh, he deals 'em off, off the top, ties 'em off
Fills it up with his past, gets carried away
Oh, half his life, a hand-me-down, wasted away
Oh, he fills it up with the love of a girl

Oh, he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway

Oh, he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four
Fills his mind with the thought of a girl

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
Getaway
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
Crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions; others walked away
A snowflake falls in may.
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out

'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now.

Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.

And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come â??round
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Good bye for now.

And the road
The old man paved
The broken seems along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me

He was guiding me, love, his own way
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just goodbye for now
You ever heard the story
Of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall
I been talkin' to my alter
Says life is what you make it
And if you make it death well then rest
Your soul away
Away away yeah

It's a broken kind of feeling
She'd have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's a comin'
Better say your prayers
I wanna tell you that I love you
But does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you dragging down.
Again, again, again.

So I'm singing
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves you alone
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind and leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady
Now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a prayer, not a prayer in sight
I owe the man some money
So I'm turnin over honey
Oh Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin' time.

This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
This is my kinda love
It's a crown of thorns
It's the kind that
It's the kind that leaves me alone
Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know.
So don't burn your bridges cause
Someday, yeah

Start singing
This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
This is my kinda love
It's a crown of thorns
It's the kind that leaves me alone
They don't eat, don't sleep
They don't feed, they don't seethe
Bare their gums when they moan and squeak
Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet

They don't push, don't crowd
Congregate until they're much too loud
Fuck to procreate till they are dead
Drink the blood of their so-called best friend

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

They don't scam, don't fight
Don't oppress an equal's given rights
Starve the poor so they can be well fed
Line their holes with the dead ones' bread , no no

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs

They don't compare, rats
They don't compare, rats
They don't compare

Ben, the two of us need look no more
Ben, the two of us need look no more
Ben, the two of us need look no more
Ben, the two of us need look no more
Ben, the two of us need look no more
Ben, the two of us need look no more
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, up straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last.

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm runnin' in my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me darling just a little while."
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night.

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
Oh, oh
Waitin', watchin' the clock
It's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more
She practices her speech, as he opens the door
She rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Oh

Talkin', to herself there's no one else
Who needs to know
She, tells herself, oh

Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to, come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone

She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Oh

She lies and says she still loves him 
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red 
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man

She loved him, yeah
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah
That's why she'll be back again

Can't find a better man
She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe, someday another child
Won't feel as alone as she does

It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck and Mommy agrees

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play, pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Don't come visit, Mother
Sing it

Oh, why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?

What you taught me, put me here
Now don't visit Mother, Mother

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
I wish I was a neutron bomb for once I could go off 
I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on 
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on 

The Christmas tree I wish I was the star that went on top 
I wish I was the evidence I wish I was the grounds 
For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky 

I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me 
I wish I was as fortunate as fortunate as me 
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good 
I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood 

I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun 
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on 
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on 
I wish I was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down 

I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up
I feel your love
I feel your strong love
I feel the patience among conditional love
I feel a strength
I feel your faith in me
I'll never let you down no matter what you do
If you just walk with me and let me walk with you
I'm on this journey I don't wanna walk alone

Walk with me
Walk with me
Walk with me
Walk with me

Walk with me
Shine me a light
Walk with me
Walk with me

I lost some people I was travelling with me
I missed a soul in the old friendship
