Lyrics
(instrumental)
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play,
What did mama say to me

That's the way,
Oh, that's the way it ought to be,
Mama say that's the way it ought to stay, yeah, yeah oh oh

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river,
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes,
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying,
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers,
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters,
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it,
When all you ears have turned away,
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see,
Is that the way it ought to stay?
That's the way
That's the way it oughtta be
Oh don't you know now
Mama said, mama said, that's the way it's gonna stay, yeah, oh oh
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good

With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin'
And a little bit of fly right down?
Ooh, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good
With a little bit of concentration
Just a little bit of helping hand
And a little bit of saving madness?
It makes me feel, oh
It makes me feel back on the ground 
Oh yes, it sure does
It makes me feel back on the ground

Babe, babe, you're the girl on the ground, yeah
I'm feelin' good child!
Down on the ground (Sha la la la, sha la la la)
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
Side a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems
Let me take you to the movies
Can I take you to the show 
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow 

From the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go 
From the door comes satan's daughter, and it only goes to show, you know 

There's an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold 
Let me wander in your garden and the seeds of love I'll sow you know 

So the world is spinning faster are you dizzy when you're stoned 
Let the music be your master will you heed the master's call 
Oh Satan and man 

Said there ain't no use in crying 'cause it will only, only drive you mad 
Does it hurt to hear them lying? 
Was this the only world you had? oh oh

So let me take you, take you to the movie 
Can I take you, baby, to the show 
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly 
Can I make your garden grow, you know
Oh, nobody's fault but mine  
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight 
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine 

The devil he told me to roll 
The devil he told me to roll 
How to roll the log tonight
Nobody's fault but mine 

Brother he showed me the gong? 
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong 
How to keep that gong alive
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine 

Got a monkey on my back
Got a mo, mo, mo, mo, monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight
Nobody's fault but mine 

I will get down rollin' tonight
No-no-no-no-no-no-nobody's fault
Hey  girl  stop what you're doin'!
Hey  girl  you'll drive me to ruin.
I don't know what it is that I like about you
But I like it a lot.
Won't you let me hold you
Let me feel your lovin' charms.

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

Hey  girl  I got something I think you ought to know.
Hey  babe  I want to tell you that I love you so.
I want to hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go,
'Cause I like your charms.

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

(Communication breakdown)I want you to love me all night
(Communication breakdown)I want you to love me
(Communication breakdown)I want you to love...yeah! I want you to love!
There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy, woman, talkin' for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leavin' me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night
(Babe, babe, babe, babe, oh)
Oh, I want you to come back home, yeah
(Oh yeah)
Sweet little girl
(You been gone so long)
You've been away so long
Now listen to me
I said I made up my mind, woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover who's gonna feel all of my, all of my, all 
Of my cares

So I met a sweet little girl just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman but she turned around, and did the same thing
Again to me, whoa

(Babe, babe, babe)
Oh baby, baby, please come home, home
(Come on home) home, yeah, it's alright
(Oh yeah) I know
(Ya been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe, babe, babe) I want you to please come home, oh
(Oh yeah, ya been gone too long)
So I made up my mind
I gonna crawl right back to you woman
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead, yeah
'Til you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Cause I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinkin' about it
I want to make you mine
Oh, babe
(Babe, babe, babe)
Babe, babe, babe, please
(Come on home)
Please come home, yeah
(Oh yeah, ya been gone too long)
I want you to oh oh
(Babe, babe, babe come on home)
I want you to come back running home to me woman
(Oh yeah)
I want you to think about when we walk through the trees together
(Ya been gone too long)
You know we had such a real good time
Whoa, here they come
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I believe it's always calling
Do you feel the brown leaf against your face you ought to sing and shout
(Oh yeah)
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
And stars fill my dream
I'm a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
And not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Oh, baby, I been blind
Oh, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
Oh, ooh yes, I been blind
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Try to find, try to find the way I feel

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like sorts inside a dream
Leave the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
As the dust that floats finds you
We're moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Cross the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, when I want, when I'm on my way, yeah
And my feet wear my fickle way to stay

Ooh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah yeah,
But I'm down oh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby
Let me take you there
Come on, oh let me take you there
Let me take you there
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way

I don't know, oh oh, yeah'

Ooh, yeah

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah!

It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down!  
Yeah! Yeah, yeah

Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!
Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that ol' fairlane
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go

Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go

The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go

I made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go

The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Baby

I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Gone up, go higher, all aboard

The devil he told me to roll

Babe, baby, baby,  I'm gonna leave you.

And I know that one day baby, it's really gonna grow, yes it is.
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day.

Come what may, every day
Oh, mama baby

It was really, really good.
You made me happy every single day.
But now!
I've got to go away!

Baby, baby, baby,
That's when it's callin' me
I said that's when it's callin' me back home.
Workin' from seven to eleven every night  
It really makes life a drag  
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best of fools  
I did what I could, yeah 
'Cause I love you, baby  
How I love you, darling  
How I love you, baby  
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah

Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling 
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling 

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?

You didn't want me no more, yeah

Yes sir you did! 

Said you know I love you baby  
My love for you I could never hide 
Oh, you know I love you baby  
My love for you I could never hide 
Oh when I feel you near me little girl

You know it hurts me deep down inside 
Oh, when you hear me, honey, baby, 
You know you're my one desire 
Yes, you are
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face 
And stars fill my dream 
I'm a traveler of both time and space 
To be where I have been 
To sit with elders of the gentle race 
This world has seldom seen 
They talk of days for which they sit and wait 
All will be revealed 

Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear 
And not a word I heard could I relate 
The story was quite clear 

Oh, baby, I been blind 
Oh, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin' 
Oh, ooh yes, I been blind 
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 

All I see turns to brown 
As the sun burns the ground 
And my eyes fill with sand 
As I scan this wasted land
Try to find, try to find the way I feel 

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace 
Like sorts inside a dream
Leave the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream 
Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon 
I will return again 
As the dust that floats finds you 
We're moving through Kashmir
 
Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Cross the sea of years 
With no provision but an open face 
Along the straits of fear 
Oh, when I want, when I'm on my way, yeah 
And my feet wear my fickle way to stay 

Ooh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah yeah,

Yeah, but I'm down, so down 
Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby 
Let me take you there 
Come on, oh let me take you there 
Let me take you there
Close the door, put out the light
No, they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold

They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through, oh
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter, oh

Walking side-by-side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more

They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh, oh, oh
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter

They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Yeah
Without quarter, quarter, yeah (without quarter)
Without quarter, quarter, quarter
Taking no quarter
Oh, oh, oh (hear the dogs of doom) (no, never quarter)
I hear the dogs of doom are howling more
Oh baby  it's cryin' time  
Oh baby  I got to fly

Got to try to find a way  
Got to try to get away  

'Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe 
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on  
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night  
Oh baby, baby when the pines begin to cry  
Baby, baby, baby  how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night  
And baby when the pines begin to cry  
Oh baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Baby how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

Oh know I  feel so strange looking out the door 
Oh tryin' hard to change but can't let go 
Oh cryin' tears of pain and more and more 
Oh everyday is the same as the one before 

I'm walkin' the floor over you 
I'm walkin' the floor
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold 
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul

Oh is it long to wait, is it much to pay? 
Oh sometimes it's hard waiting for the day

You know it's hard I said it's hard 
You know it's true I said it's hard 
You know it's hard you know it's true 

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed ?
In the eye of the night  ?
In the day everything ?
She was smilin' a tear at her waters fall ? 

You know it's true now
You know it's true now uh uh yeah

I'm walkin the floor over you 
I'm walkin' the floor
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Does it matter now?
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so 
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go 
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace 
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face 
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
That's alright, it's awful dog-gone clear 

Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean 
Oh, oh, baby, why you treat me mean 
You didn't have to crucify me like you did 
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid 
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean 
You didn't have say you'd always be by my side 
Why' didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushin' bride 
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean 
But that's alright, I know your sisters, too 

You didn't have to tell me that you love me so 
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace 
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
But that's alright, I'd be the same way, too 

Oh yeah, yeah, oh baby

You didn't have to crucify me like you did 
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid 
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here 
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own 
You didn't have to tell me, baby, let me go 
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you 
That's alright, I know your sister, too 

What's the matter with you, mama
I've been to London, seen seven wonders I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for
There can be no denying, that the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying, and there's a new plague on the land

(If we could just join hands)
(If we could just join)

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me 
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight  I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe

(If we could just join hands)

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry, and I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder, of earthly plunder, will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flying, see the candle burning low
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old

(If we could just join hands)
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes

(Yeah)

And if you feel that you can't go on 
And your will's sinkin' low 
Just believe and you can't go wrong 
In the light you will find the road (You will find the road) 

Hey, oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you 
Standing out in the cold 
Hey, babe, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through 
To the very depths of my soul, yeah 
Oh, baby, I just want to show you what I'd give you 
It is from every bend in the road 
Now listen to me 
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey 
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load 
Let me share your load, ooh, let me share, share your load 

And if you feel that you can't go on 
In the light you will find the road 

Hey, oh, though the winds of change may blow around you 
But that will always be so 
Wow-wow, wow-wow, when love is pain it can devour you 
If you are never alone 
I would share your load, I would share your load 
Baby, let me, oh, let me 

In the light
Everybody needs the light 
In the light, in the light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, oh, yeah 
Light, light, light, in the light
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

Sunday morning when we go down to church
See the menfolk standin' in line
I said they come to pray to the Lord
With my little girl, looks so fine
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around
Lookin' for my street corner girl

I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind sharin' what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play

I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman and she won't be true

(Hey hey what can I do) I said she won't be true

No, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah (hey, hey, what can I say?)

Ah (hey hey, what can I do) keep on, keep on

Messin' around with every guy in town
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new
Always the same  playin' your game
Drive me insane trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but baby  I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you woman

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do want you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talkin' all around
Watch out woman, no longer

You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

Your time is gonna come

Your time is gonna come

Your time is gonna come
Uh-look-ah there
There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else
From the window of your rented limousine 
I saw your pretty blue eyes 
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
I must be the one you need, yeah 

Clutching pages from your teenage dream 
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the LA queens 
How fast your learn the downhill side 

Oh, how you like my face? 
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe 
Oh yes, I must be the one you need, yeah

Oh, you got me feeling
Just a bit, just a bit

Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen 
Come on, flash it in my eyes 
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
Baby I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

Oh, give it to me, come on now

Hours, hours, and the moments in between 
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times 
The fun of comin', oh the pain in leavin' 
Baby, dry those silver eyes 

Oh, do you know my name? 
Do I look the same? 
You know I'm the one you want 
Oh yes, I'm the one you need 

Oh, that's right, oh, yes that's right
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, that's right
In the days of my youth
I was told what it was to be a man
Now I've reached the age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to do the same old jam

Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days
Till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine
And love me till the end
When I whispered in her ear
I lost another friend

Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times
You know I had my share
When my woman left home
With a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
Her face is cracked from smiling  
All the fears that she's been hiding  
And it seems pretty soon ev'rybody's gonna know. 
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing  
And she worries if their days are few 
And soon they'll have to go. 

[Chorus]
My my my I'm so happy  
I'm gonna join the band  
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We are in the promised land. 

She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in, 
Then she wonders what it's all about 
When they break down the door. 
Her name is brown or white or black, 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy 
As the winners toll the bell. 

[Chorus]

There is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination, 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more. 
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there 
Tho' it takes a little longer, 
And when you see it in the distance 
You will wring your hands and moan
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, oh

All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Aryan one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin, oh

All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you

All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you 

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind, oh

All of my love, all of my love, oh
All of my love to you

All of my love, ooh yes, all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, love, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, oh love
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah, it's all my love

All of my love, all of my love, to you now

All of my love, all of my love
all of my love to, to you, you, you, yeah

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Don't want you wasting my time 
Tired of ya doing the things that you do 
It's no use standing in line 
Follow the line, you better follow queue 

I say, oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love 

Oh, it's my love 
Oh, it's my own true love, my my own

I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead

I save a lifetime forever?
But you know, you know, you know what I say 

And I say oh, it's my love

We-ell, I can't quit you baby, 
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell, I can't quit you baby, 
But I got to put you down a little while
We-ell you done made me mess up my happy home, 
Made me mistreat my only child

Ah, when you hear me moanin' and groanin', 
Whoa you know it hurts me way down inside
Whoa when you hear me moanin' and groanin', 
You know it hurts way down inside
Oh when you hear me howlin', 
Ooh you know my love will never die, alright

Well when you see me cryin', 
Don't let my tears fall in vain
Well when you see me cryin, darlin', 
Please don't let my tears fall in vain
Lord, I don't know what to do, 
You know my heart is filled with pain

Whoa, when you hear me howlin', 
Baby, you know it hurts way down inside
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

A man I know, went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street
You know it's right
You can see my friend,
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor
Doin' up my hair

New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White

One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand 
Oh oh oh oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Oh oh oh oh
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around 
Oh
And she said, don't you want to?  
Don't you want to cook it, cook it, cook it? 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah

Ooh, heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned 
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground  
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to, did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 

You want to do it, you want to 
You want to do it when you want to 
You want to do it, do it when you want to 

When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might 
When you fake it, mama 
Please fake it right (for yourself babe)

When you fake it baby
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you want to 
Do it, do it, do it 
Do it when you want to 

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal
Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it (fryin') 
For your life 
For your life
I want to tell you 'bout my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names but
He sure is a good friend and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, no
If I tell you you won't come again, hey
I ain't gonna tell you nothin' but I do will, but I know, yeah
Now let me tell you 'bout my girl
Open up a newspaper and what do I see? Ahh, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me
Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Lemme tell ya, when she talks, she talks 
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I want to make her mine, yeah
Tell me baby what you want me to do?
And you want me to love you, love some other man too?
Ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no
Oh, I don't need no respect from nobody, no, no
Ahh, no no, ahh
I ain't gonna tell you nothing I ain't gonna tell you no more, no
She's my baby, let me tell you that I love her so and, and 
She's the woman I really want to love and let me tell you more, ooh
She's my baby, lemme tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a-woman, the one a-woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going tell you 
I ain't going tell you one thing that you really ought to know, ooh
She's my lover, baby, and I love her so and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl!
And she's the kind of lover that makes me me fill the whole world and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, ooh
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about
Take it on, take it, take it, take it
Ah, excuse me
Oh, will ya excuse me
I'm just trying to find the bridge
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please
Have you seen the bridge?
I ain't seen the bridge!
Where's that confounded bridge?
(Oh, hot dog)
Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said "you-haul" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright, You know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Crazy ways are evident
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

You told your mamma I'd get you home
But you didn't say I had no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright, You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
I received a message from my brother across the water 
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight 
So I said goodbye to all my friends 
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox 
'Cause I know it's time to fly 

Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning 
Meet me in the middle of the night 
Ah yeah, the morning light is comin' 
Don't it make you want to go and feel alright 

I just jumped a train that never stops 
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride 
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand 
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 

Oh yeah, come on, meet me in the morning 
Want you meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin' 
Don't it make you want to go and feel alright 

Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin' 
Nothin' here to make me stay 
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin' 
They're knockin' down them doors 
They're tryin' to take me away 

Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell 
And ring loud and clear
Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell 
Tell the people they got to fly away from here 

I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby 
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile 
We are in the middle of a change in destination 
When the train stops, all together we will smile 
Oh, come on, come on now meet me in the morning 
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night 
Oh oh, yeah, everybody know the mornin' time is comin' 
Don't it make you want to feel alright 
Ah, ah, yeah, make me feel alright 
Fly now, baby 
Get to fly, yeah 
Fly now, baby
Oh, hey, hey
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay.
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Lord  mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh  well  oh  well  oh  well.
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They go no work to do,
If you don't know about Chicago.
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home.
Going, go'n' to Chicago,
Go'n' to Chicago,
Sorry but I can't take you.
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down
going down now, going down
Going d-d-d-d-down
Woo woo
Then as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

Did you ever really need somebody 
And really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody 
The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me, baby 
Did it feel so good
'Cause it was just the first time 
And you knew you would
Through the eyes an' I sparkle
Senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way 
See your feathers preen
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes 
Didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest 
The nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face 
The way it used to be
Oh darlin', oh darlin'

I'm never gonna leave you 
I never gonna leave
Holdin' on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone 
Ten years gone, holdin' on
Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back.
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes.
I had a dream
Oh, yeah
Crazy dream, uh-huh
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song
Yeah, people don't you listen now?
Sing along
Oh
You don't know what you're missing, now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow, push push, yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh

Here we go, here we go
All you gotta do, now
All you gotta do, now
Ooh-ee
Sing out Hare-Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie-Koo
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Oh
You know you shook me
You shook me all night long.
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long.
You shook me so hard baby
Baby, baby, please come home.

I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing.
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing.
I have a baby, won't do nothing  oh!
Oh, oh, buy a diamond ring.

You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long.
I know you really, really, did baby.
I said you shook me, baby.
You shook me all night long.
You shook me so hard, baby.
You shook me all night long
In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules

Oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness,
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
'Cause you can only blame yourself

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Yeah, I need your love
I just got to have

Oh, it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, fortune
'Cause that's all that's left to you
Oh, it's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop, oh

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I just got to have

Ooh, whatever that your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
'Cause that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh yeah, I need your love
I just got to have, I just got to have
How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
Oh, twenty-four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah
One minute seems like a lifetime 
Oh baby, when I feel this way 
Sittin' lookin' at the clock 
Time moves so slow

Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seems to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime

Which in the end is you anyway 

How come twenty four hours 
Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way 

There was a time that I stood tall 
In the eyes of other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman 
And now I can't get back again 

How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah
Well, well, well well
A minute seems like a lifetime 
Baby when I feel this way

Sing out Hare-Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie-Koo
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Oh
It was an April morning when they told us we should go
As I turn to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?

Oh, the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again
Slipping off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole

Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground

Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowds, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone

If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow

Oh the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search?
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth

For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh lord, well I did it again
Now I've got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

Oh, Rosie, oh, girl, oh, Rosie, oh, yeah

Well I've got to get to you, baby, oh, please come home
Why don't you listen to me, babe
Why don't you please come home

Oh, baby
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for night
I hate to think I been blinded baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a burning
And the thrill of your touch give me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up and make it alright, yeah?
It's alright right

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me baby
Whatever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
It ain't the first time believe me baby
I'm standing here feeling blue, blue ha!
Yes I'm blue
Oh, babe

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around, 'round
And the clock on the wall's moving slower
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe, ooh

Hand that ticks on the clock
Just don't seem to stop
When I'm thinking it over
Oh, tired of the light
I just don't seem to find
Have you wait, yeah played
Whoa, I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be with you, you
I gotta get it all, gotta get it all, gotta get it all
I've got to get all

Ooh now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet, oh
I got no reason to doubt you baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey!
And the thoughts of a fool's gotta count
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

Hey, now, oh, oh, oh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the hey, now light of the hey, now
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Close the door, put out the light
No, they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold

They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through, oh
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter, oh

Walking side-by-side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more

They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh, oh, oh
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter

They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Yeah
Without quarter, quarter, yeah (without quarter)
Without quarter, quarter, quarter
Taking no quarter
Oh, oh, oh (hear the dogs of doom) (no, never quarter)

Ay ay ay ay ay ay
All those tears I cry, ay ay ay ay
All those tears I cry, oh oh ah ay

When I read the letter you wrote me, it made me mad mad mad
When I read the news that it told me, it made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so
I can't let you go

Oh, baby I love you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Every breath I take, oh oh oh oh

Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow
The hammer of the gods
W'ell drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming!

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah-ah, ah!
Ah-ah, ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
Think I see my friends coming
Riding a many mile
Friends did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming
Riding a many mile
Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother
To keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver
I brought a little gold,
I brought a little of everythin
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming
Riding a many mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him
Save me from the wrath of this man, man

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many mile, mile, mile
Oh, yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She brought my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah
Your brother brought me silver
Your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard
And see you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard
And see you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling 
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
Oh
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should, you know I should
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
Side a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems
Ah caught you smiling at me,
That's the way it should be,
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah all the good times we had,
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

As we walk down the country lanes,
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees,
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

Well if the sunshine's so bright,
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes,
I'll be singing a song, Hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees,
Telling mother nature 'bout you and me

My, my la de la come on now it ain't too far,
Tell your friends all around the world,
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle
Come on now well let me tell you,
What you're missing, missing, 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure,
It's a friendship so pure,
Angels singing all around My dog is so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my nat'ral life with you,
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim,
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again,
We'll still go walking down country lanes,
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name
[Anderson Theatre version]
I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
I'm being abused,

And I think I should know,
Come on baby,
I'm starting to crack,
If you're out to get me,

You're on the right track.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
I'm dazed and confused,

Hanging on by a thread,
Come on baby,
Do you want me dead?
I can arrange that for a dollar or two.

I can't remember,
Anything about you.
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

Hey!
I'm dazed and confused,
Hanging on by a thread,
I'm being abused,

I'd be better off dead,
If you're out to get me,
You're on the right track,
Quittin' teasin',

I'm starting to crack.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Hey, hey, hey!

[Cumular Limited Version]

I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
Give me a clue,
'Cause I just want to know.

Give me a clue as to where I am at,
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat.

Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,
Yeah I'm,

I'm dazed and confused,
Hangin' on by a thread,
I've been abused,
I'd be better off dead,

Can't stand the heat,
And I'm starting to crack,
If you're out to get me,
You're on the right track.

Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
I'm dazed and confused,

Is it stay, is it go?
I still love you,
But I still want to know,
Secrets are fun to a certain degree,

This one's no fun 'cause the secret's on me.
Yeah, yeah,
Hey, hey!
Hey!

I'm dazed and confused,
Is it stay, is it go?
I've been abused,
And I sure want to know,

Give me a clue as to where I am at,
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat.
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abused tellin' all of your lies
Run around sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby, here I come again
Every day I work so hard
Bringin' home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away

Don't know where you're goin'
Only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will
Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand 
Oh oh oh oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Oh oh oh oh
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around 
Oh
And she said, don't you want to?  
Don't you want to cook it, cook it, cook it? 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah

Ooh, heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned 
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground  
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to, did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 

You want to do it, you want to 
You want to do it when you want to 
You want to do it, do it when you want to 

When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might 
When you fake it, mama 
Please fake it right (for yourself babe)

When you fake it baby
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you want to 
Do it, do it, do it 
Do it when you want to 

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal
Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it (fryin') 
For your life 
For your life
Asked sweet mama, Let me be her kid 
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid" 

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark 
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark 

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side 
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah 
I know my baby, Lord, I said, "is really sloppy drunk" 
I know my mama, Lord, a brown skin, but she ain't no plum 

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home 
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone 
See my baby, Tell hurry on home 
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone 

Hey, she promises, She's my rider 
I want to tell you, She's my rider 
I know you're mine, She's my rider 
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider 

I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side 
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied 
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in 
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 
She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time 

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg 

Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about 
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl 
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed 

She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brown skin sugar plum
Been in town, my baby 
We just got to rock on 
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home 
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, honey 
We've been shakin' all night 
Oh, darlin', we just got to roll right 
Ah, oh, my head rock on, rock on 

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock

Let's go

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah
There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
Down by the seaside 
See the boats go sailin'
Can the people hear 
What the little fish are sayin'

Oh, oh, the people turned away 
Oh, the people turned away

Down in the city streets, 
See all the folk go racin', racin'
No time left, to pass the time of day

The people turned away 
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run, 
See how they run, see how they run

Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I want to tell you 
Some go twistin' every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

Out in the country, 
Hear the people singin'
Singin' 'bout their progress
Knowin' where they're goin'

Oh, oh, the people turned away
Yes, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine 
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for lady nature 
And she will come back again
The people turned away
The people turned away
In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn 
All I want for you to do is take my body home 

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy 

Jesus, gonna make up/out siviers

Oh I believe I did

I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces

And I see them in the streets 
And I see them in the field 
And I hear them shouting under my feet 
And I know it's got to be real 
Oh, Lord, deliver me 
All the wrong I've done 
You can deliver me, Lord 
I only wanted to have some fun

Hear the angels marchin'

And I love you Darlene
Yes I love you I do 
?
I've been saving all for you
Oh I love ya
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oh

It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh
Talk talk, talk, talk
Hey, I felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us, 'pon us
But I know that I love you so
Oh, but I know
That I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the wind, they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch
We all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient, quotient
Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Silent woman in the night, you came 
Took my seed from my shaking frame 
Same old fire, another flame 
And the wheel rolls on 

Silent woman through the flames, you come 
From the deep behind the sun 
Seems my nightmares, have just begun 
Left me barely holding on 

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 

Is it every time I fall 
That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call 
Another day has just begun 
You babe

Silent woman, my face is changed 
Some know in ways to come 
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame 
And the wheels rolls on, rolls on
Bright light, almost blinding
Black night, still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
"You got love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only, looking for what I knew

Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just-

Met a man on the roadside crying,
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew.
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
Oh, yeah
My, my
My, my
My, my
My, my
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy
It's very easy
It's very easy
It's easy-easy, yeah, yeah
Her face is cracked from smiling  
All the fears that she's been hiding  
And it seems that pretty soon, everybody's gonna know

And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing  
And she worries if their days are few  and soon they'll have to go

My, my, my, I'm so happy  
I'm gonna join the band  
We  gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We are in the promised land 

She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 

Her name is brown or white or black 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 

My my my I'm so happy  
We gonna join the band  
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We're in the promised land. 

Oh, there is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there 
And though it takes a little longer 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan

Oh yeah, you'll moan
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, you'll moan, you'll moan

You're g-gone, you're g-gone, yeah-yea
You're g-gone
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my you are gone
You're gone
My, my, my
You're gonna, gonna get there, it's just a little longer
And when you see him in the distance you will wave your hand
Leaves are falling all around
It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain
And with it pain
And it's headed my way

Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And thoough our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'T was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one 
crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do, no

I guess I keep on rambling
I'm gonna, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing my song (I gotta find my baby)
I'm going 'round the world (I gotta ramble on sing my song, gotta work my way around the world baby, baby)
Ramble on, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, my baby
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (my, my, my, my, my, my baby)
Oh, I can't find my bluebird (my, my, my, my, my, my, yeah)

I keep rambling baby (I keep, I keep, I keep)
I keep rambling baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball, uh uh, uh uh, yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way

I don't know, oh oh, yeah'

Ooh, yeah

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah!

It sure is fine!
Ah blow my mind!
When the tears are goin' down!  
Yeah! Yeah, yeah

Oh so, oh so, oh so good!
Oh so good!
Hey fellas have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town?
It won't take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new but the face is the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart

Ohh yeah, long time ago

Here's a tale of Tom 
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreamin' of the day 
He could turn and say 

Poor Tom, work's done, 
Been lazin' out in the noonday sun 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

His wife was Annie Mae 
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town 
She couldn't keep her dress down 

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Always knew what's goin' on 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

And so it was one day 
People got to Annie Mae 
Tom stood, a gun in his hand 
And stopped her runnin' around 

Poor Tom, seventh son, 
Gotta die for what you've done 

All those years of work are thrown away 
To ease your mind is that all you can say? 

But what about that grandson on your knee? 
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

(Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom) 
Hey
(Keep-a truckin')
Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do you  what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey  Boy  do you want to score?
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind.
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said
Please, hey, would we care to all get in line
Get in line
Well you know
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, oh
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it

You really don't care if they're coming oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, oh.
If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care
Don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, oh, I really don't know
Oh, she's my baby 
Let me tell you why 
Hey, she drives me crazy 
She's the apple of my eye 
'Cause she is my girl 
And she can never do wrong 
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down 

Hey, I love that little lady 
I got to be her fool 
Ain't no other like my baby 
I can break the golden rule 
'Cause I get down on my knees 
Oh, I pray that love won't die 
And if I always try to please 
I don't know the reason why, yeah 

If she would come back 
Only stay with me, oh yeah 

Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of my love, a pretty girl 
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit, every little bit of my love, oh

I don't have to go by plane 
I ain't gotta go by car 
I don't care just where my darling is 
People I just don't care how far 
I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl
I don't care if I got to go back home 
I don't care what I got to stand to her back 
I'm gonna crawl, I'm gonna crawl 
Ah, I'm gonna move the car, baby 
Ah, she give me good lovin', she give me good lovin' 
She give me good lovin', she give me good lovin', my baby give me good lovin'
Yes, I love her, I guess I love her, yes, I love her 
I'm gonna crawl
I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
(And a) tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

On the corner of Bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver ran down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So I looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

Oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe
I lost my way

Hey babe, hey babe
I really, really, really

Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm gonna find it

Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe
Let me tell you
It just feels, it just feels, it just feels, it just feels so good
So good, so good
oh yeah
Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Oh, oh, oh 

Oh, oh 

Oh

Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow
Bow

Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip, throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed

They had to stay
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take off the fruit, but guard the seed

Take off the fruit, but guard the seed
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
Mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
It starts out like a murmur 
Then it grows like thunder
Until it bursts inside of you 
Try to hold it steady 
Wait until you're ready 
Any second now will do 
Throw the door wide open 
Not a word is spoken
Anything that you want to do 

Ya know, ya know, ya know
Ya know, ya know, ya know

Don't you feel the same way? 
Don't you feel the same way? 
But you don't know what to do 
No time for hesitatin' 
Ain't no time for hesitatin' 
All you got to do is move 
They say you're feeling blue, well 
I just found a cure 
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah 

(Ya know, ya know, ya know)

Now listen, when you say your body's aching? 
I know that it's aching
Chill bumps come up on you 
Yeah, the funny fool 
I love the funny fool 
Just like foolin' after school? 
And then you ask for medication 
Who cares for medication 
When you've worn away the cure 

(Ya know, ya know, ya know)

(Hey, hey)
Go back to the country yeah, go back to the country 
Feel a change is good for you 
When you keep convincin' 
Ah, don't keep convincin' 
What's that creeping up behind a you? 
It's just an old friend, it's just an old friend 
And what's that he's got for you? 

(Ya know, ya know, ya know)

Yeah, yeah, yeah I can feel it, I can feel it ?
Oh, medication, medication, medication
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Oh let me get it back let me get it back
Let me get it back baby where I come from

It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
Yes it has
It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back  carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break  
If it keeps on rainin'  levee's goin' to break  
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay. 
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan  
Lord  mean old levee taught me to weep and moan  
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home  
Oh  well  oh  well  oh  well. 
Don't it make you feel bad 
When you're tryin' to find your way home  
You don't know which way to go? 
If you're goin' down South 
They go no work to do, 
If you don't know about Chicago. 
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good, 
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good, 
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move. 
All last night sat on the levee and moaned, 
All last night sat on the levee and moaned, 
Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home. 
Going, go'n' to Chicago, 
Go'n' to Chicago, 
Sorry but I can't take you. 
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down, going down, going down, going down
Going down, going down now, going down
going down now, going down
going down now, going down
Going d-d-d-d-down 
Woo woo
c'mon Everybody

Well c'mon everybody let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it all 
Well I been doin' my homework all-a week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
And who cares? 
c'mon everybody 
Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
A-my-ma-my

Oh yeah I really need it 
Yeah! 
Well we're gonna have a party but we better put a guard outside 
If the folks come home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide 
Well there'll be no more movies for a week or two 
no more runnin around with the usual crew
Well I want to know who cares? 
c'mon everybody
Measuring a summer's day, I only finds it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain

Tangerine, Tangerine, living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen, and now a thousand years between
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these? 
To think of us again?
And I do

Tangerine, Tangerine, living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen, and now a thousand years between
Drop down, baby, let your daddy see

Drop down, drop down, drop down
(I chew on a piece of your custard pie)
With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Alimony, alimony payin' your bills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman (ah, I'm kidding man)

Nobody hears a single word you say
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the round about, ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, is oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am 
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man 
One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride 
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 
And the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child  come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey, whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
Only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey whoa
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
Only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh

Hey, oh
Oh the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show-ow-ow
Catch the wind, we're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail, little girl
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh
My my my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But does anybody know I'm gonna move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, Lord
Baby, baby, baby, oh, right now, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, come on, now
If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be loving you 
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me 

Kind woman, I give you my all 
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain 
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by 
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die 
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me 
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles 
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done 
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad 
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine 
I would still be loving you 
Mountains crumble to the sea 
There will still be you and me
