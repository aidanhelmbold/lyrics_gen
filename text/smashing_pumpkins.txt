Lyrics
I'm in here
Please take me home
Starla dear
I'm all alone 

When you can't decide what's on your mind
It's clear I'm here, Starla dear

To disappear takes so much time
Starla dear, you're on my mind

Soon, soon I'll be leaving
Soon, soon I'll be leaving
I hear all you're saying
I hear all you're failing

I'm in here
Please take me home
Starla dear
I'm all alone
Serve yourself No one else can do for you like you
And no one else fails like me
In my eyes I burn alive
Fly like a bird
No more words just you and I
High in the sky
Well I met a girl called Sandoz
And she taught me many many things
Good things, very good things
Sweet things

I met her on a Sunday morning
It was hot though the snow lay on the ground
Strange things, very strange things
My mind has wings
Sandoz, Sandoz
Will you tell me "No?"
Sandoz, Sandoz
Will you tell me why?
You could honor something from your mind
Yeah

She's very old yet, many think she's young
One kiss from her and you know your time has come
Good times for all time
Sandoz
If life is my witness
Love is my song
If nothing means no one
Then blank, I belong
If fear conquers easy
I can lead on
Milk from the flower
Blood from the dawn

So here we are
Upon your stage
The laughs we shared
The dreams we saved
Bleeding the orchid
We're bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
Blessed my weakness
Blessed my wrongs
As hate forms the sequence
Of one by one
As freedoms die easy
We suffrage the want
There's clouds in my shower
Ghosts in my arms

Youth is where you are
Faith some sinner's child

We're bleeding the orchid
We're bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
Gilded art this silent march past triumph thru alarm
So thus charmed
Does this will stand for much?
But heart's untouched by heart's unloved
Bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
Here we are
Upon your stage
The love we share
The dreams we'll save

They're bleeding the orchid
They're bleeding the orchid
They're bleeding the orchid
Bleeding the orchid
To the center of the earth 
Or anywhere God decides 
Full of fever pulling forth 
We hear our call as all 
To the center of the earth 
As if written in 
DNA is reaching out 
To your frequency 

I want to live 
Don't want to die 
I want to live 
I want to try 
All in prayer
Prayer in all 
All are scared
Scared of all 

Black rooms are calling 
To men in leather coats
White labs are cooking 
Up the silver ghost 
The glass migrates under 
Her translucent skin 
And all are spiders
Wonder what we've got us in 

All is you 
You are all 
All with you 
You in all 
I want to live 
I don't want to die 
I want to live 
I want to try 

"So it's all very obtuse, because it's all, like, I don't know. So, like, I started thinking that everything I operate on is based on what I believe God was telling me to do. God could be my intuition or whatever, but I always assume, I always assume that the voice I hear is the voice of God. Then I started thinking, what if I'm insane? So I'm operating on the premise that I'm hearing the voice of God or what I perceive to be God speaking to me or through me, but maybe I'm completely in...so all my...demagoguery in my life about me thinking that my life has importance, my, my...thinking that my life has importance. My--my--my thought of it and the fact that I believe I'm following my intuition which in and of itself may be completely false. So then I started freaking out, thinking--of itself may be completely false. And again this creature that believes he's acting upon heavenly intuition but meanwhile he's totally rampant. And I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against--and I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against--and I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against..." 



So meets the final coda of a vinyl storm 
One more cherry cola to lift up her dead arms 
A dream of soft focus, sunsets filters through the din 
We are losing contact as she dials it in 
She can hear glass calling, or is it someone that looks like him? 
She eyes TV reflection, and nods a knowing look 
She says it doesn't matter, she never liked her looks 
I have seen a thousand fractures, I have seen everything 
'Cause knowing is its own answer, love something in a book 
There's not much left to ponder, not much left to cook 

As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her 
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As far as you take me  
That's where I believe 
The realm of soft delusions
Floating on the leaves 
On a distant shoreline  
She waves her arms to me 
As all the thought police  
And closing in for sleep
 
The dilly dally  
Of my bright lit stay 
The steam of my misfortunes 
Has given me the power to be afraid 
And in my mind I'm everyone 
And in my mind 

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life 
It's what you take that makes it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue 
Porcelina, porcelina

In the slipstream, of thoughtless thoughts 
The light of all that's good 
The light of all that's true 
To the fringes gladly 
I walk unadorned 
With gods and their creations 
With filth and disease
Porcelina, she waits for me there 
With seashell hissing lullabies 
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own 
Hidden thoughts and alibis 
My secret thoughts come alive
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life 
It's what you take that makes it right 
And in my mind I'm everyone 
And in my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone of you 
You make it right 
It's all all right 
You make it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Who am I to need you when I'm down 
Where are you when I need you around 
Your life is not your own 

And all I ask you 
Is for another chance
Another way around you 
To live by circumstance, once again 

Who am I to need you now 
To ask you why to tell you no 
To deserve your love and sympathy 
You were never meant to belong to me 

And you may go, but I know you won't leave 
Too many years built into memories 
Your life is not your own 

Who am I to need you now 
To ask you why to tell you no 
To deserve your love and sympathy 
You were never meant to belong to me 

Who am I to you? 
Along the way 
I lost my faith 

And as you were, you'll be again 
To mold like clay, to break like dirt 
To tear me up in your sympathy 
You were never meant to belong to me 
You were never meant to belong to me 
You were never meant to belong to me 

Who am I?
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
My reflection dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover  I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when you're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Want to go for a ride?

She's the one for me
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me

Emptiness is loneliness  and loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me
Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth

I never let on, that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me
She's my one and only
She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors
And I said, I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, another one should come to one another
No one should come between us
Still I was lonely, and she was by my side, my one and only
Knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game
'Cause I was lonely and she was crazy
Rat-tat-tat, ka boom boom, now take that, and just a bit of this
'Cause I'm a watcher, and I'm a doer of none
Come to save you, 'cause you're all mine

I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine
Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss
'Cause I'm a sister, and I'm a motherfuck
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, no one should ever come
In between us, between us and our love

Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went I was sure to go
Now Mary's got a problem, and Mary's not a stupid girl
Mary's got some deep shit, and Mary does not forget
And this is how Mary's garden grows, and this is how Mary has her ghosts
And into the eyes of the jackal I say ka-boom
Now we begin descent, to where we've never been
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
And she will never learn
She will never learn
Bye bye, baby goodbye, bye, bye
Wrap me up in always
And drag me in with maybes, yeah
Your innocence is treasure, your innocence is death
Your innocence is all I have
Breathing underwater
And living under glass
And if you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears

I believe in never
I believe in all the way
But belief is not to notice, belief is just some faith
And faith can't help you to escape
And with this ring I wed thee true
And with this ring I wed thee now
And with this ring I play so dead
But no one's asking for the truth, so let me tell you
If you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears
To the revelations of fresh faced youth
No one will come to save you
So speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
But youth is wasted on the young
Your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate
My love for you just can't explain
Why we're forever frozen, forever beautiful
Forever lost inside ourselves
The night has come to hold us young

The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
Pick your pockets full of sorrow
Run away with me tomorrow
June 

Try, ease the pain
Somehow we'll feel the same
Well, no one knows
Where our secrets go

I send a heart to all my dearies
When your life is so, so dreary
Dream
I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream

And I fail
But when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will

Mother weep the years I'm missing
All our time can't be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
Cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
So bad

When I can, I will
Words defy the plan
When I can, I will

Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Old enough to always feel this
Always old, I'll always feel this

No more promise no more sorrow
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me
I just want to be me
When I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will
When I passed you in the doorway 
You took me with a glance
Should have took that last bus home 
But I asked you for a dance 
Now we were steady to the pictures 
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
Father says "he's going crazy" 
Says I'm livin' in a trance, 
Dancing in the moonlight 
It's caught me in it's spotlight, 
It's alright, it's alright, the moonlight 
This long, hot summer night 
It's three o'clock in the morning, I'm on the streets again
Disobeyed another warning, Shoulda been home by ten 
Now I stay out 'till Sunday, I have to say I stayed with friends 
It's a habit worth forming, It's a means to justify the end 
Dancing in the moonlight 
It's caught me in it's spotlight, 
It's alright, it's alright, the moonlight 
This long, hot summer night 
I'm walking home 
Last bus is long gone
Smiley, where have you been?
Smiley, it's such a sin to say
You'll dream your life away 
No one met him, couldn't make it on a bended knee

All his friends were simple prophets only if he please
And he'll wait on his knee
Smiley, where have you been?
Smiley, it's such a sin to say

You'll dream your life away
Your love won't change
Come back to stay

Smiley Smiley Smiley Smiley
Smiley Smiley Smiley Smiley
And you- if I'm smilin'
Then I'm tryin'
'Cause I'm smilin'
We dismiss the back roads 
And ride the streets unafraid
Resort to scraping pain 
From our bones unashamed 

No more the eye upon you 
No more the simple bane 

Desolation yes  hesitation no 
Desolation yes
You wrap your arms around 
A feeling that surrounds 
Like liquid peppermint 
Just taste the drinks that she served 

And this feeling shivers down your spine 
Love comes in colors I can't deny 
All that matters is love, love, your love 

You're sleeping in your bed 
Just rest your weary head 
Maybe you shouldn't care 
Throw away those dreams and dare 

And I wonder if it matters to me 
Love comes in colors I can't deny 
All that shimmers is love, love, your love 
Your love 
Your love
Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need

Spaceboy I've missed you
Spinning round my head
Any way you choose me
You'll break instead
Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life

I don't need
I don't care
Please

I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
'Cause when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home

Spaceboy they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And any way you choose me
We won't be long

We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
Speak to me in a language I can hear humour me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again
I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And you can make it last, forever you
You can make it last, forever you
And for a moment I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return
I'll make the effort, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
And you can make it last, forever you
You can make it last, forever you
Hold silent
You were my violence stuck
In my life
Just for the moment
And let me under you
So you can die

I was alive
I was alive

In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out
In my body
The lonely creatures
The lonely creatures scream

June's offcast
Left hiding, I form the screams
Burned alive
Wasted sunsets
Haunting my torment
Right through my clothes

In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out

I was alive
I was alive

In my body
You'll never find me
You'll never pull me out
In my body
The lonely creatures
The lonely creatures scream

In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah

In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah

In my body
In my body
In my body, yeah
It's in blood
I suppose
Breaking jars
I'm no good
As the prodigal son

And I know that you're mesmerized
You had a vision, made these laws
And sanitized, are we above desires
I miss him so

You are so fucked
It has begun
Revolution crawls
All over you
I was listening

You light up the sky
And scrape out your skull
Your lovely face
Will never be claimed thrice

And we're so unlikely to
Upon my wrists I bear the cross
My losses mount as I climb across the home
Of my own soul

I'll claim my prize
I don't exist
I am divine
A ghost with eyes
Take me down to the underground 
Won't you take me down to the underground 
Why, oh why  there is no light 
And if I can't sleep can you hold my life 
And I, all I see is you 

Take my hand, I lost where I began 
In my heart I know all of my faults 
Will you help me understand 
And I believe in you 
You're the other half of me 
Soothe and heal
When you sleep, when you dream  
I'll be there if you need me, whenever I hear you sing

There is a sun, it'll come, the sun, I hear them call me down 
I held you once, a love that once, and life had just begun 
And you're all I see 
And trumpets blew, and angels flew on the other side, dear 
And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need 
There's a love that god puts in your heart
And on her doorstep I saw that I was blind
I'd forsaken what was mine
What it mattered, mattered little now
We had shattered, apart somehow
I can't help but stay the same
I'll remain true to my name
Time to get up and take the long walk home
For the first time I go alone
Do you remember when we first met
Chasing down the alleyways behind my dad's
I can't help but stay the same
I remain true to the name of lovers past
Good enough to lose
And good enough to chose you too
Window Paine
Around my heart
Shadows streak
Around my heart 

Do what you got to do
And say what you got a say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today

Wind blow shame
Around my heart
Shadows scream
Around my heart

What are you coming to
Stripped down to the bone?
Laughing, living on your own
All alone

Do what you got to do
And say what you got a say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today
Boredom's in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
Sally's in the stirrups claiming her destiny
And nobody nowhere understands anything
About me and all my dreams
Lost at sea

Jack it up Judy, set your heart alight
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
Misspent youth - faking up a rampage
To hold off the real slaves
Paid off and staid

And what you never knew
Can never get to you
So fake it

I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you

Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
No matter what you say, he'll be back for more
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
Of tears and idle threats
Misplaced and

And no matter what they do
They can't get to you
So fake it

I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you me

Come around Ruby I could never sleep alone
I know that we are young.
And I know you may love me.
But I just can't be with you like this anymore.
Glissandra.

She's got both hands
in her pocket.
And she won't look at you,
Won't look at you

She hides true love
En su bolsillo.
She's got a halo 'around her finger.
Around you.

You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose.

Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.

Don't call my name, Tristessa.

Glissandra.
Glissandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
(Just stop. Please. Just let me go. Glissandra. Just let me go.)

She's not broken,
She's just a baby.
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad.
and all those flames that burned before him.
Now he's gonna fight your fight, gonna cool the bad.

You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose

Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.


Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.

Glissandra.

Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra. [2x]

Don't bother me.
Don't bother me. Glissandra
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Starla.

I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Glissandra.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch. Starla.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.

Soul power (soul power) [Repeat: x4]
Soul power
Everywhere you are 
Is everywhere you've been 
Just lost to the beat 
Punching through your skin 
You don't know what to do 
But still you want to crawl 
All through the broken glass 
That's everywhere you are 

Your love must always be true 
Your love must always be you 

Everywhere you are 
Anywhere you go 
Even if you're starved 
It matters what you do 
But even if you've gone too far 
You can follow you 
Everywhere you are 

And in your mind 
You were alone 
All this time 
With everything you were 
And every smile you wore 
Still locked in your heart
Everywhere you are 
Everywhere you are 
Every single chard
Everywhere you are 
You're never too far 
'Cause anywhere you'd go 
Even to the stars 
All you have to do 
Is play the part of who you are 
The rest is up to you 

Phase unwound 
By yourself 
Atom bomb 
On the shelf unsung
Pause of light
Pulse of life 
New face dawns
Everywhere you are 
And everywhere you go 
Even if you're down 
Even if you're low 
The thought of you 
It's in the eyes of all 
Astride a storied past 
That's everywhere you are 

Your love must always be true 
Your love must always be you 

Everywhere you are 
Anywhere you go 
Even if you're scarred 
It's all a part of you 
But ever should you put it down 
You can never lose me 
Everywhere you are
With the sugar sickness 
You spy the kidnap kid 
Who kids you to oblivion 
It's the perfect hassle 
For the perfumed kiss 
He makes you miss him more than home 

You love him 
You love him more than this 
You love him and you cannot, you can't resist 
You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 

Past sidewalk ashes 
A last lovers arc 
You come apart to intertwine 
It was all so simple 
As you watched him move 
Across the darkness in your room 

You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 

And the winding vines 
The pretty boys dive 
And through the pinhole stars 
Into the shadow mind 
You will lose him then 
On some gentle dawn 
This boy is here and gone 

You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 
You love him 
You love him more than this 
You love him and you cannot, you can't resist 

You love him...
I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, I turned around
And I saw my reflection in a snow covered hill
'Til a landslide brought it down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I've
Built my life around you
Time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too
I'm getting older, too

I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, I turned around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hill
The landslide brought it down
The landslide brought it down
Beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come

And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass
Wanting you

Beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sky
Wonderful, it's wonderful
To know that you're just like I

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who'll you love and who you won't
No, who'll you love and who you won't

And I love you, as you love me
So let the clouds roll by your face
We'll let the world spin on to another place
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all
To look down on you and me and them

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you'll love and who you won't
No, who'll you love and who you won't
No no, who'll you love and who you won't
No no

Don't let your life wrap up around you
Don't forget to call, whenever
I'll be here just waiting for you
I'll be under your stars forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
I'll be under the stairs forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
Quiet
I am sleeping
In here
We need a little hope 

For years
I've been sleeping
Helpless
Couldn't tell a soul

Be ashamed
Mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Silent
Metal mercies
Castrate
Boys to the bone

Jesus
Are you listening? 
Up there
To anyone at all

We are the fossils
The relics of our time
We mutilate the meanings
So they're easy to deny

Be ashamed
Mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I don't trust you
I can't hear you

Be ashamed
Mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Behind me
The grace of falling snow
Cover up everything you know
Come save me from the awful sound
Of nothing
You've gotta understand
You've gotta understand
It's just a fact that you must attack
You gotta get it while you can

Well, everyone's gonna be a big star
Everyone's gonna drive a fast car
Everyone's gonna be in charge
'Cause everybody's business is everybody's business

Yeah, we hope you'll understand
Yeah, we've got a master plan
Yeah, we're an american band for you

'Cause when you're hypnotized
'Cause when you're hypnotized
They'll spin you gold and paint you black
With the blood of your surprise

Well, everyone's gonna be a big star
Everyone's gonna drive a fast car
Everyone's gonna be in charge
'Cause everybody's business is everybody's business

Yeah, we'll help you party down
Yeah, we're coming to your town
Yeah, we're are an american band for you

Yeah, nobody understands
Yeah, that we've made our plans
Yeah, we're tearin' it down for you
For you

Everyone's gonna be a big star
Everyone's gonna drive a fast car
Everyone's gonna be in charge
'Cause everybody's everything is nobody's nothing
Everyone's gonna get a big gun
Everyone's gonna shoot someone
Everyone's gonna ruin our fun
'Cause everybody's business is everybody's business

You've gotta understand
You've gotta understand
It's just a fact that you must attack
You gotta get it while you can

Well, everybody's business is everybody's business
Everybody's business is everybody's business
Everybody's business is everybody's business
Everybody's business is everybody's business
Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change the less you feel
Believe, believe in me, believe

That life can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same, we're different tonight
Tonight, so bright
Tonight

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light

And the embers never fade in your city by the lake
The place where you were born
Believe, believe in me, believe
In the resolute urgency of now

And if you believe there's not a chance tonight
Tonight, so bright tonight
We'll crucify the insincere tonight
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight
We'll find a way to offer up the night tonight
The indescribable moments of your life tonight
The impossible is possible tonight
Believe in me as I believe in you, tonight
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
When will it start to sway
When will it start to almost break you
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again 

I'll miss you
And I wish you luck
Well, I forgive you
And I don't wish you away, away, away
It'll almost break you
Almost take you
Almost break you
Almost break you up
What moon songs
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring? 

Who belongs
Who decides who's crazy
Who rights wrongs where others cling?

I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you

And those moon songs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through

I'll hear your song
If you want me to
I'll sing along
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you, and you

I'm in love with you
So in love
I'm in love with you
With you
I'm in love with you, and you

I'm in love with you
So in love
I'm in love with you
I'm so in love
I'm in love with you, have you
It's you that I adore
You'll always be my whore
You'll be the mother to my child
And a child to my heart
We must never be apart
We must never be apart
Lovely girl you're the beauty in my world
Without you there aren't reasons left to find

And I'll pull your crooked teeth
You'll be perfect just like me
You'll be a lover in my bed
And a gun to my head
We must never be apart
We must never be apart

In you I see dirty
In you I count stars
In you I feel so pretty
In you I taste god
In you I feel so hungry
In you I crash cars
We must never be apart
Drinking mercury
To the mystery of all that you should ever seek to find
Lovely girl you're the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I've left behind
In time
We must never be apart

And you'll always be my whore
'Cause you're the one that I adore
And I'll pull your crooked teeth
You'll be perfect just like me
In you I feel so dirty in you I crash cars
In you I feel so pretty in you I taste god
We must never be apart
Run to me, run to me
Where the sun
Never leaves
Run to me, my special love
Run to me

At first perceptions before yourself
Who came and sung from where you are?
You can escape this, by someone else
Your lover?

Run to me, run to me
My special one, run to me
Run to me, run to me
My lover strange
Run to me, you can't be changed
Run to me, run to me

Where the frogs spoils the lean
Run to me, run to me
As the desert rose
Desert dreams
Run to me, my tempest age, run to me
I've faced the fathoms in your deep 
Withstood the suitors quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you 
Appease you 
The wind blows and I know 

I can't go on, digging roses from you grave 
To linger on, beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep 
And whirlpools sleep, you'll find me 
The coarse tide reflects sky 

And the night mare rides on, and the night mare rides on 
With a December black psalm 
And the night mare rides on 
What I fear is lost here 
The wind blows and I know 

All you have to do is run away 
And steal yourself from me 
Become a mystery to gaze into 
You're so cruel in all you do 
But still I believe, I believe in you 

So may you come with your own knives 
You'll never take me alive 
With all the force of what is true 
Is there nothing I can do? 

I can't go on, digging roses from you grave 
To linger on, beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep 
And whirlpools sleep, you'll find me 

And the night mare rides on, and the night mare rides on 
With a December black psalm 
And the night mare rides on 

I've faced the fathoms in your deep 
Withstood the suitors quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you 
To hold the flower I can't keep
I spin off and lose my head
Throwing stray a spark instead
Gather strength down in my heel
And dig it in the world I peel 

Way down deep within my heart
Lies a soul that's torn apart
Tell me, tell me what your after
I just want to get there faster

I don't live - I inhale
I don't give - I unveil
Don't want to live in your misery
I don't live - I inhale
Sprinkle all my kisses on your head
Stars full of wishes fill our beds
She said, "I'm dead"

All this pain smothers me
Like a bomb that you can't see
Tell me, tell me what your after
I just want to get there faster

I don't live - I inhale
I don't give - I unveil
I don't live - I inhale
I don't live
What moon songs
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring? 

Who belongs
Who decides who's crazy
Who rights wrongs where others cling?

I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you

And those moon songs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through

I'll hear your song
If you want me to
I'll sing along
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you, and you

I'm in love with you
So in love
I'm in love with you
With you
I'm in love with you, and you

I'm in love with you
So in love
I'm in love with you
I'm so in love
I'm in love with you, have you
You can hear the baby bones
Crack beneath her wheels
Tears of Avalon
Streak silent down her shield
High crimes and misdemeanors
Unfortunate attacks
Will leave you standing nameless
While she's turning black
Vanity stands naked at my door
Vanity cries, why?

Eleanor, you've lost me
In a haze of wine and cocaine
Gone out and cost me
Everything I blame
Broadcast in TV detail
To call their own stories
As I try to recapture
Our best in former glories
Vanity stands naked at my door
Vanity cries, why?
Vanity wants everything and more
Vanity must die

She swears she'll turn around
Turn around for good
She swears she'll turn around
Turn around for sure
You know you'll run around
Run around for her
You know you want to know so pure

Ease on that dirt road
You've still a ways to go
Soak in sights and city lights
While you still can borrow
Cursed fall will find you
And bring a memory
The ghost of her surrender
With the kiss of anarchy

She's naked at my door
Vanity cries, why?
Vanity wants everything and more
Vanity must die
Die
Dorian, Dorian
What have you done?
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A setting sun, it finds you

Is it always as you want?
Is it always as you thought?
Dorian

What have you done?
Dorian
Oh my child, when our number's up and done
It's what they taught
Dorian
As you run, a setting sun
Dorian
A fleeting dream, it finds you

Is it always as you thought?
Is it always as you want?
Dorian

What have you done?
Dorian
A setting sun
Dorian
Whoever finds you, whoever finds you
She will never, ever go
Waiting for her man
Waiting for her man
She will never, ever know
Waiting for her time
Waiting for her time
Walk the world, I hear a noise
Standing in her voice
Sickle in her choice
She is everything
Monday or Tuesday
Wednesday's another game
Waiting for Sunday
I'm the one she swore she'd never love
I'm the one I know she's thinking of
She will never, ever burn
Waiting for her town
Waiting for her town
She will never, ever sit
Waiting for her game
Waiting for her game
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I'll never be

I torch my soul to show
The world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies

A crown of thorns
An image formed deformed
The mark I've borne
A mark of scorn to you

Consume my love devoure my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out the stars invite
I think I'll leave tonight

So that soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what's coming down
Do you know I couldn't stay free' 

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free free
Free as the voices
It's all I need

I shall be free
I shall be free
Lover, lover let's pretend
We're born as innocents
Cast into the world
With apple eyes 

To wish wish dangerous
My dear delirious
To try and leave
The rest of us behind

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

Kiss kiss all of this
The hiss that we had miss
And understand what can't be understood

Sear those thoughts of me
Alone and unhappy
I never liked me anyway

If by chance
Or circumstance
We should fail
Don't be so sad

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

In a dream
We are connected
Siamese twins
At the wrist

And then I knew we'd been forsaken
Expelled from paradise
I can't believe them
When they say that it's alright
Words can't define what I feel inside
Who needs them?
Caught with this virus of my mind
I give in to my disease, of my needs
To my disease, of my needs

She really loves to break
Her dad says it's OK
She really loves to break
And give it all away

Her ma says she's afraid
What more can she fake
She really needs to break
And give herself away

She gave it all away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
We really love the USA
Sweet sweet sweet sweet little agony
I don't know just where you've been
But I'll take take take
All that you have for me
In sin
Where are we going? 

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

And the sad sad sad
All the sad faces drown
In this town
Where are we going?

And they all want you to change (where are we going?)
And they all want you to change (where are we going?)
Life is so strange when you don't know 
How can you tell where yore' going to 
You can't be sure of any situation
Something could change and then you won't know 
Ask yourself
Where do we go from here 
It seems so all to near 
Just as far beyond as I can see 
I still don't know what this all means to me 
Tell yourself 
I have nowhere to go 
I don't know what to do 
And I don't even know the time of day 
I guess it doesn't matter any way 
Life is so strange
Destination unknown 
When you don't know 
Your destination
Something could change 
It's unknown 
And then you won't know 
Destination unknown 
Life is so strange
Destination unknown 
When you don't know 
Your destination
Something could change 
It's unknown 
And then you won't know 
Destination unknown 
You ask yourself 
When will my time come 
Has it all been said and done 
I know I'll leave when it's my time to go 
Till then I'll carry on with what I know 
Life is so strange
Destination unknown 
When you don't know 
Your destination
Something could change 
It's unknown 
And then you won't know 
Destination unknown 
Life is so strange
Destination unknown 
When you don't know 
Your destination 
And something could change 
It's unknown 
And then you won't know 
Destination unknown 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange 
Life is so strange
Wrap me up in always
And drag me in with maybes, yeah
Your innocence is treasure, your innocence is death
Your innocence is all I have
Breathing underwater
And living under glass
And if you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears

I believe in never
I believe in all the way
But belief is not to notice, belief is just some faith
And faith can't help you to escape
And with this ring I wed thee true
And with this ring I wed thee now
And with this ring I play so dead
But no one's asking for the truth, so let me tell you
If you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears
To the revelations of fresh faced youth
No one will come to save you
So speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
But youth is wasted on the young
Your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate
My love for you just can't explain
Why we're forever frozen, forever beautiful
Forever lost inside ourselves
The night has come to hold us young

The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
Unleash the Armageddon 
So all the children go to heaven 
I sit by quiet still 
With their pictures on my eyes 
You'll draw the guns you're given
Write down the words as written 
And never disturb the presence 
Of resurrection crutch 

And it's about time 
It's about drawing near 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears
Descend the darkened stairways 
Make hate with plastic playmates 
And fire out remaining traces 
Of your self-esteem
Mainline the deepest secrets 
Lick clean the dirty fingers 
I am a stranger to you 
As you are to yourself 

And it's about time 
It's about fear 
Blue skies bring tears 
Don't you want me 
As I awake the city sigh 
We'll watch the seasons die 
Blue skies bring tears 

Take me inside your body 
Cover me with your soul 
To the darkest recess 
Is where I wish to go 
You are the greatest flower 
That I have ever devoured 
I ask for nothing given 
For nothing in return 

Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears 
Blue skies bring tears
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Widow wake my mind

I'm looking for a love, a love that shines

Are you real this time?

I'm looking for a love that I can find
To be mine, a love that's mine
It'll shine, in my mind
A love that shines
Accept the grace, the moment you are in
Accept the chase of where we must begin
'Cause when you crawl, you crawl into my heart
And when you fall, you fall right in my arms

We'll shine, yes, we'll shine
Our love will shine
You'll be mine, yes, all mine
Our love will shine

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm looking for a love that I call mine

Shine, we'll shine

I don't care if you hurt me some more
I don't care if you even the score
You can knock me and I don't care
You can mock me and I don't care
You can rock me just about anywhere
It's alright
'Cus you're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
You're all I've got tonight
I need you tonight
I don't care if you use me again
I don't care if you abuse me again
You can make me I don't care
You can fake me I don't care
You can love me just about anywhere
It's alright
I don't want to feel sorry for you
You don't have to make believe it's you
You can pump me I don't care
You can bump me I don't care
You can love me just about anywhere
It's alright
Tried to tell her who I really am 
But I'm not so sure that I really can 
Well, you've got to know, I don't understand 
Well, you've got to know who I really am Give me one more chance
As I child, I once had a dream 
My mother spoke something down to me 
She said, "Son, you must walk upon your knees 
Down the road, headed for the East" 
Give me one more chance 
Give me one more chance 
If I had a way to go, I'd gather up my throwing stone
Tried to tell her who I really am 
But I'm not so sure that I really can 
Well, you've got to know I don't understand 
'Cause I'm not so sure who I really am 
If I had a way to go, I'd gather up my throwing stone 
If I had a way to go, I'd gather up my throwing stone
Say, now listen here
I want to be oh so clear
I lost my soul, lost I'll stay
Between your hands and my beliefs
And here I am, frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare

Tug at my sleeve
My little girl, super maid
She don't know that I have stole my smile from a Cheshire cat
And all I wanted was to be a man
Since I gave up
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

The two of us, that's dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for him

Try to understand
The ones that love
And their demands
It's so unfair
When they can't see
That I'm the boy
Who really needs
Their love,
I suppose
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
Born to please every simple need
I stand alone in my thoughts indeed
Hate you for ever making me
I'm in you, I'm your anything
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
Come to me, let me hold you still
I'm so tired, just as tired as you
Take me for anyone but me
All that you feel is never true
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever, my star
Could never every let you go
And never let you know
Let roar these fears 
To the whore of my tears
Pure as a lie
I pour to your eyes
Suck you like the sap from a tree
Honey from the dew
From the bumble bees
I want you and I need you
All you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever, my star
I'll never let go
Never let you know
Mother I'm tired 
Come surrender my son 
Time has ravaged on my soul 
No plans to leave but still I go 

Fallin' with the leaves
Fallin' out of sleep 
To the last goodbyes 
Who cares why? 

Mother I've tried
Wasting my life 
I haven't given up, I lie 
To make you so proud in my eyes 

Fallin' out of sleep
Crawlin' over me 
To the last goodbyes 
Who cares why? 

Tuesdays come and gone 
Restless I still drive 
Try to leave it all behind
Fallin', fallin' out of sleep
Fallin', fallin' with the leaves 
I go crawlin', crawlin' over me 

Once upon a time in my life... 
I went falling... 

Mother I hope you know 
That I miss you so 
Time has ravaged on my soul 
To wipe a mothers tears grown cold
If I was 
I'd turn back
Give up all my reasons
Forget the past

You think I'd swallow
Bearing the weight of the ceilings
Just to stop and [ask?]

Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein

They give you this
They take away that
Fluorescein

They'll be no rallies
They'll be no long last 
Empty on the inside
Running out of the last protests
Standing by the feeling of an end

[stowaway or slow away?] [lights or life?]
Runaway [love or life?]

When they lit you up
You shut me out
They gave me the keys so I could show you around
But we were not around
Ominous of a day dream of a cottage [abound?]
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein
Fluorescein

They give you this
They take away that
Fluorescein

They'll be no rallies
They'll be no long last ...
Coming [or cutting?] out of the spotlight
Running out of the last protests
Standing by the feelings of an end

[stowaway or slow away?] [lights or life?]
Runaway [love or life?]

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back, pale horse
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back, pale horse
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back, pale horse
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back, pale horse
This is the last song
This is the last song I'll sing for you
This is the last song
This is the last song I can give you
The roaring city sleeps
Metal fingers clutching dirty sheets
And no one comes for free
In this place where the angels sleep
This is the last song
My eyes are open
My eyes are open wonder to this
As you hold the secrets
I count the minutes off so perfectly
The shards of broken glass
Sing the strains of a sad old tune
We've made it at last
But what we had is lost inside our past
This is the last song
Could you find away across me
To forgive and forget me
To appease and relent me
To deceive and detect me
To understand and release me
To the dawn
This is the last song
This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The best I ever had
This is a song for a kid
This is a song for a tailor
Who stitched up my old hearts
Who stitched up my old hearts

And I
I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come

This is a song for a dove
This is a song for a blown out bird
The kind that don't return to the nest
This is a song for a star
This is a song for a space invader
Who flew into the sun
Never to return
Never to return

I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many more, many more to come
Many more to come

This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The son I never had
He sailed without a map
This is a song for that kid
This is a song for that tailor
Who stitched up my old hearts
Before I broke it all
All apart

I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many more, many more to come
Many more to come

Ye daughters of the revolution
Carry back your sons
Carry them back home

Ye daughters of the revolution
Carry back your sons home 

This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The best I ever had
He sailed without a map
I know we're just like old friends 
We just can't pretend 
That lovers make amends 
We are reasons so unreal 
We can't help but feel that something has been lost 
But please you know you're just like me 
Next time I promise we'll be 
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line 
Lovers out of time 
Memories unwind 

So far I still know who you are 
But now I wonder who I was... 

Angel, you know it's not the end 
We'll always be good friends 
The letters have been sent on 

So please, you always were so free 
You'll see, I promise we'll be 
Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet 
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we meet 

Perfect 
You know this has to be 
We always we're so free 
We promised that we'd be 
Perfect
Whenever I run 
Whenever I run to you lost one 
It's never done 
Just hanging on 

Just past has let me be 
Returning as if dream
Shattered as belief 

If you have to go don't say goodbye 
If you have to go don't you cry 
If you have to go I will get by 
Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side 

But for the grace of love 
I'd will the meaning of 
Heaven from above 

Your picture out of time 
Left aching in my mind 
Shadows kept alive 

If you have to go don't say goodbye 
If you have to go don't you cry 
If you have to go I will get by 
I will follow you and see you on the other side 

But for the grace of love 
I'd will the meaning of 
Heaven from above 

Long horses we are born 
Creatures more than torn 
Mourning our way home
Im not here to hold your hand
Im just here to understand
If youre feeling low I can help
Im always on your side
Forever near your light
Im always on your side
However you must fight
Within your darkest night
Im always on your side
Lovers as lonely as lanterns lost
Show me faiths real cost
Im always on your side
Forever near your light
Im always on your side
Wherever you must fight
Within your darkest night
Im always on your side
They wont rush you from me
Cause here Ill always be
Im always on your side
Forever near your light
Im not here to hold you down
Im just here to love you when

Your stars align and you let me
And your heart win
Im always on your side
Forever near your light
Im always on your side
Lover, teach me sweet command
Show me where I land
Im always on your side
Im always on your side
Forever near your light
Im always on your side
However you must fight
Within your darkest night
Im always on your side
With evidence of trust
And eminence of love
Im always on your side
Capitulate and fade
Resurrect and break
Im always on your side
Forever in your light
Im always on your side
Lover, light the way
My daydream seems as one inside of you
Though it seems hard to reach through this life
Your blue and hopeless life

My daydream screams bitter 'til the end
The love I share -true- selfish to the heart
My heart, my sacred heart

My daydream dream
My daydream
My daydream dream
My daydream

. . .

I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I don't want feelings
Your feelings

I have gone crazy
Motherfucking crazy
I have gone
There you are  as you always were 
In bathing light and naked blue 
You're a part of me  eternal one 
By grand design and setting sun 

If you wait  I will wait 
Taste  I will taste 
If you love  I will love 
Run  I will run 
To my last breath 

Last night I turned around and thought I saw myself turning
Inside the strangest dream of life  unloved and cities burning
Awake in my arms you cry unshamed 
Our age of the hours while they still devour all 
So take it all, I doubt if we will know it's gone 
'Cause we've been here since time began
Begged God awake and make these plans
Wound opens, reveal this broken man 
And soon there's notions of blood on his hands 

If you wait, I will wait 
Taste, I will taste 
If you love, I will love 
Run, I will run 
To my last breath 

Last night I turned around and thought I saw myself turning 
Last night I turned around and thought I watched the world ending
Inside the crushing down I felt a pang, the tide was turning
Destroyed in the wake 
The jealous ingrates 
Who'll tear this world down 
To spite God above 
With his own love 
With his own love 

If you wait, if you wait 
If you wait, I will wait 
Taste, I will taste 
If you love, I will love 
Run, I will run 
To my last breath
C'mon let's go
I'll find you waiting there
Beyond their violence dared
A light around your soul

You could be my friend
Lovely and different
Crushing up the stars above us
A guarantee to spoil our rot

Tears were once my only way back home
Someone speaks and instantly I'm cold

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go
Beyond the great unknown
Beyond their punched-up skulls
To die upon this road

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go

Anesthetized I'm hollow
Playing to the dark back row

C'mon let's go
Go
C'mon let's go

Assimilate, it's all been staged
I've made mistakes, they penetrate
They're gonna take, it's all the same
They cannot wait, their love spells hate

I wanna love
I wanna love
I'm pushing back
I'm serpentine
I'm pushing back

Lord save me
With need
Lord walk me home

C'mon let's go
C'mon, c'mon let's go

Tears were once my only way back home
Someone weeps and instantly I'm thrown

C'mon let's go
C'mon let's go
Go
C'mon let's go
How I love you
Isn't fair
God must want me
Next to you there
And if I show up
To disappear
Will you find me
Half as near?

Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars

Of all the lovers
To be a friend
I'll come back when
You know me

And it's a sad state
Of happiness
If I confess
To my loneliness
Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars
Tangled in your body
Spangled by the night time stars

How I've loved you so
It's how I've loved you so

Butterflies don't fly
Broken hearts don't cry no no
How I've loved your body, baby
How I've loved your sapphires and rubies
Butterflies don't make it in movies

How I've loved you so
God I love you so
God I love you so
I'm on the street yeah
I want you
I'm looking for myself

I'm gonna make it
I'll take it
Like everybody else

Belle of the fawning
I'm yawning
Sister can't you spell
Above suspicion
Hey listen!
I'm digging my own hell

'Cause I want you bad
'Cause I want you bad

And without peer
And without fear
I'm without anyone at all
I'm torn apart, decrying
How unjust you are
For bursting
My black heart

'Cause you don't want me no more
But just you worry
'Cause when they scratch-scratch my door
You'll hurry
Ah one, two, three

This gun is loaded, devoted
You postulate the rest

Riding the seesaw
There's no law
That I have ever met

I'm just a flat punk
On dead junk
Riding a vanguard

Cut from the vaunted
I'm haunted, till death do us part

'Cause I want you bad
'Cause I want you bad

Fall in hate with me
With one trick
You will want it all
The yeah-yeah tears
The now and here
The without anyone at all
I'm torn without
I'm crying out for doom

'Cause you don?t want me no more
But babe don't worry
'Cause when you scratch-scratch my door
I'll show you, either or ?

We are the lurking
The panzers
The black as coal as night
Stealing the stealthy
And stellar
Until we get it right
Notice the yearlings
The dead things, the pretty as you please
The pretty as you please

I am the regent, the marquis
Sowing my bad seeds

'Cause I want you bad
'Cause I want you bad

Fall in hate with me
With one trick
You will want it all
As St. Patrick pipes on!
I am one as you are three
Try to find messiah in your trinity
Your city to burn
Your city to burn
Try to look for something
In your city to burn, you'll burn
Am I as I seem?
I'm down
Down, so down 

Time is right for a guiding light
Try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
Your city to burn
Your city to burn
Try to look for something
In your city to burn, you'll burn

See you, don't you just want to
See you, I am one
See you, don't you just want to
See you

See you, don't you just want to
See you, I am one
See you, don't you just want to
See you, I am one
You say I'm beautiful
Well I can't help it
You say I'm empty
We all know I'm full of shit

Get out, get out
You've lost control
Get out, get out
You're growing cold
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?

You say I'm tragic
I say it's magic, kid
You say I'm lucky
We all know it's in the cards

Get out, get out
Get out, get out
You've lost control
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?
Do they want to be you?
Bring it, Jimmy
Floating
Knocked out, sky high, floating
Flat out, deadly truth
Does anyone want to be you?
Can anyone, anyone be true?
Does anyone, anyone want to be you?
Do they want to be you?
All your seven dreams
Look close, son, and you'll believe
As your things come undone
See you are the only one 

Flower, seize the hour I did
I wait Waiting, waiting for your wake
I'll wait

When you wake up you're all weak
Throwing your life away
Someday, sorry coming home
Sorry snail
What you wait for

Flower, the pain will wash away, away
When the sun shines
Climbs through your window into your bed

When you wake up you're all weak
Throwing your life away
Someday, sorry coming home
Sorry snail
Down in my heart
Flower save the hours
Flower away

What you wait for
Flower chase the sunshine
Flower chase the sunshine
Flower
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out 

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings
Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known
(listen-want to just start it?...ready, flood?
Yeah...one, two, three, four)
Stay with me, I'll set you free
'Cause I can tell you once were pretty
Rose so sad you've lost your petals
And lost the luster of your tattle tales
I need a love to help me find my way
I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
Time has lost its hold on me
Hatred sleeps inside my bones 
In the stillness of cool air
All the boys have been left for dead
'Cause we know where they fear to tread
The beautiful ones, the ones we'll remember
The precious ones, our greatest pretenders
I need a love to help me find my way
I need a strength that I cannot betray
I need a word to say what I can't say
I need a lover, lover
I need a lover, lover
And if you lose yourself
Could you take me, too?
Could you rest inside the sleep?
Stay with me, I'll set you free from you
Your words will one day spite your face
And another mouth will come and take its place
It'll speak and speak and speak and sputter me dry
I will never understand the motive drive
Muck..You..Up..Muck
In a dream I wander on
To the bell tower.. writing songs
So I crumple this page, and rip it up
Never piece my broken heart to you
Muck..You..Up..Muck
Your words will one day spite your face
And another mouth will come and take its place
It'll speak and speak and speak and sputter me dry
I will never understand the motive drive
Muck
Your words, will spite your face
Your words, will spite your face
Spiteface
Spiteface
Spiteface
Spiteface
Radio play my favorite song 
Radio radio
Radio I'm alone
Radio radio
Please don't let me go  radio 

I peer through curtains on empty streets
Behind a wall of caller ID 
No one's out there 
To hear if I care 
About the troubles in the air 

'Cause I of the morning now go 
Pick up where my thoughts left off 
'Cause I'm home to die on my own 

As my radio plays my favorite song 
Radio, radio
Radio, don't you know 
Radio, radio
Radio, I'm alone 

I've blown the dust off my guitar 
In the attic with the stars 
I read your letters to feel better 
My tears upon the faded ink 

'Cause I of the morning now go 
Pick up where my thoughts left off 
'Cause I'm home to die on my own 

As my radio plays my favorite song 
Radio, radio
Radio, don't you know 
Radio, radio
Radio, I'm alone 

I sit in the dark light 
To wait for the ghost night 
To bring the past to life 
To make a toast to life 
'Cause I have survived 

What is it you want? 
What is it you want to change? 
What is it you want? 
What is it you want to change? 
What is it you want to change? 

Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio 

What is it you want? 
What is it you want to change? 
What is it you want? 
What is it you want to change? 
What is it you want to change?
Never been kissed by a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, love me true, ooh
Everything I want, I had to have
And with madness, it's love that's sad
Trust little baby, oh can't you see?
Ooh, it's me

Ode to the alien weekend
Wednesday's ring starts to turn slow
You said show them one weakness
Then fill that happy heart

With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you
Ooh, with a girl like you

Times that preach how it's been
As the straw lives on without
You're so alone, they'll let you in
Ooh, if they let you in

Ode to the alien weekend
Stoned where it starts to burn slow
You said show them one weakness
Then give my hand a hold

With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
To love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you

You can say, I will listen
You can swear, don't mind
You can blot out tradition
Till I'm bored
With a girl like you
With a girl like you, ooh
With a girl like you, ooh, ooh

I'm so alive with a girl like you
I'm so alive with a girl like you
Trust little baby, can't you please?
Thrown a girl like you
They poison our sweet mother earth
Destroy our sacred bodies
To fill our mouths with junk and
They call this knowledge
But knowing nothing
Means knowing far, far too much
They let our children
Starve in the name of peace
They march to the beat of
A killing machine

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Scars and bars and 51 stars
In faith and milk and...
I'm drinking filth and disease
Oh pretty please, I'm begging freedom
There's lives to be blinded,
Serviced and kinded
Before we've paid
And then we'll pay some more
Do you know the score?
Cause I'm so fucking bored!

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul

They'll sell your wounds as evidence of your hope

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream
Life is not a,
Life is not a dream
Life is not a dream
No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you drown
You've traveled very far
Just to see you I'll come around
When I'm down
All of those yesterdays
Coming around 

No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you dream 
You traveled very far
You traveled far, like a star
And you are
All of those yesterdays
Coming around 

Is it something someone said?
Was it something someone said? 

Yesterday the sky was you
And I still feel the same
Nothing left for me to do
And I still feel the same 

I wish, I wish I could fly
I wish, I wish I could lie
I will, I will try
I will, I will
Goodbye
Farewell goodnight last one out turn out the lights
And let me be, let me die inside
Let me know the way from of this world of hate in you
'Cause the die is cast and the bitch is back
And we're all dead yeah we're all dead
Inside the future of a shattered past
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
For knowing better, for knowing this
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad
To save me the wasted, save me from myself
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
Everybody's lost just waiting to be found
Everyone's a thought just waiting to fade
So fuck it all 'cause I don't care
So what somehow somewhere we dared
To try to dare, to dare for a little more, yeah yeah
I lie to just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes there are no reasons
Well I met a girl called Sandoz
And she taught me many many things
Good things, very good things
Sweet things 

I met her on a Sunday morning
It was hot though the snow lay on the ground
Strange things, very strange things
My mind has wings
Sandoz Sandoz
Will you tell me no?
Sandoz Sandoz
Will you tell me why?
We could all learn something from your mind, yeah

She is very old yet many think she's young
One kiss from her and you know your time has come
Good times, for all times
Sandoz
Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need

Spaceboy I've missed you
Spinning round my head
Any way you choose me
You'll break instead
Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life

I don't need
I don't care
Please

I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
'Cause when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home

Spaceboy they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And any way you choose me
We won't be long

We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
My reflection dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself 
I'm your lover  I'm your zero 
I'm the face in your dreams of glass 
So save your prayers 
For when you're really gonna need 'em 
Throw out your cares and fly 
Want to go for a ride? 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 

Emptiness is loneliness  and loneliness is cleanliness 
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me 
Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms 
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth 

I never let on, that I was on a sinking ship 
I never let on that I was down 
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore 
You blame yourself for wanting more 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 
She's my one and only
Lily my one and only 
I can hardly wait till I see her 
Silly I know I'm silly 

'Cause I'm hanging in this tree 
In the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me 
And through her window shade 

I watch her shadow move 
I wonder if she
Lily my one and only 
Love is in my heart and in your eyes 
Will she or won't she want him 
No one knows for sure 
But an officer is knocking at my door 

And through her window shade 
I watch her shadow move 
I wonder if she could only see me? 
And when I'm with her I feel fine 
If I could kiss her I wouldn't mind the time it took to find 
My lily, my one and only 

I can hardly wait till I see her 
Oh lily, I know you love me 
'Cause as they're draggin' me away 
I swear I saw her raise her hand and wave (goodbye)
On the day that you were born
They built an empire off a scream
I cant explain
Endlessly theyll set you free
Give you reason to believe
This empty place
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Im gonna love you 101 percent
Im gonna love you til this ends
Take a chance if you should go
Face upon your happy home
The scanners wait

Selfishly they might concede
You were always on your own
You cant escape
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
Youre not me and never ever will you be
Im gonna find you and never run against
Im gonna find you til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even while their numbers call you out
Everything I want is free
Free youre free with me
Youre free with me

Well I met a girl called sandoz
And she taught me many many things
Good things, very good things
Sweet things 

I met her on a Sunday morning
It was hot though the snow lay on the ground
Strange things, very strange things
My mind has wings
Sandoz sandoz
Will you tell me no?
Sandoz sandoz
Will you tell me why?
We could all learn something from your mind, yeah

She is very old yet many think she's young
One kiss from her and you know your time has come
Good times, for all times
Sandoz
Freak out
And give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So I'm told

Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Hipsters unite
Come align for the big fight to rock for you
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
We are frightened and we're scared
If you don't stare

Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told

Who wants honey
As long as there is some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Fairy tales and time in whales
Substitutes for sin
It takes some life to find the light within
Whistle past the lane lover
Whistle past the lane
Cause loves forever strange
Nestle on the moon, sunshine
Nestle on the moon
Should you hear that faint murmur
Of what love might do
Seven stars that shine
In my mind, oh my mind
Ill take you with me where I climb
In my mind, oh my mind

And if Im wrong Im right
Im never gonna lose you
If Im wrong Im right
Take me to your life

Summertimes the only child
Summertimes the only child this night
You want to brace the golden fool
Lets make this right
Nightingales and nursery crimes
Twins that spark the charts
It takes some trust to find a trust apart
Whistle past the lane lover
Whistle past the lane
Cause loves forever strange
Nestle on the sun, starlight
Nestle on the sun
Should you hear the faint murmur
Of what love has done

Seven stars that weep
In my sleep, oh in my sleep
Ill take you with me where I keep
In my sleep, oh in my sleep
And if Im wrong Im right
Im never gonna lose you
If Im wrong Im right
Take me to your life

All you need is you, lover
All you need is you
All you need is you, lover
So please need me too
What you need is love, stranger
What you need is love
When your love needs its danger
Please let me through when Ive got you
A live wire moves slow
A transformer always knows
The score is four
Leaves you hanging on the floor
For more and less and more of the blame
And she's tired
And she's sick of the same old shit
It's just more of the same old same
I know she wants more and more and more to witness
To lay down and bear true
A cherry onion firefly
Tastes sweet and white
As you are blue
Knows just what she wants to do
With you below the silver skies
Don't hate her because she's undecided
And she's tired
And she's sick of the same old shit
It's just more of the same old same
I know she wants more and more to stomach
In honor of her youth
She's not sorry she's happy
Sorry she's happy
She's not sorry she's happy
Sorry she's happy as a turtle
She's a real live transformer
I fear that I am ordinary  just like everyone
To lie here and die among the sorrows
Adrift among the days
For everything I ever said
And everything I've ever done is gone and dead
As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
My life has been extraordinary
Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singing in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong
As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinking that I'd last forever

But I knew exactly where I was
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul

And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world so hard to understand

Is the world your can't live without
And I knew the silence of the world
We only come out at night
We only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

And once again
You'll pretend to know me well
My friends

And once again
I'll pretend to know the way
Through the empty space
Through the secret places of the heart

We only come out at night
We only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

I walk alone
I walk alone to find the way home
I'm on my own
I'm on my own to see the ways

That I can't help the days
You will make it home okay
I know you can
And you can

We only come out at night
We only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

And once again now
You'll pretend to know that
That there's an end
That there's an end to this begin

It will help you sleep at night
It will make it seem that right is always right
Alright?

We only come out at night
We only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night
Got me a ray gun
Got me an altitude
Can't help feelin' something's wrong
With everyone of you 

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

Talk revolution
As if it matters now
I don't care anyway
Just give me what I want

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

Ooh, honey
Fill me with your little whispers
Store your little nightmares
Of a generation set to burn

Come on honey
Let's go for a ride
Down where the crickets learn and sing and play, baby

Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head

Yeah, it's a motherfucker, oh
Dusty screams, through doors and imaginary floors 
"Why can't you miss me?" 
Pistol Pete removes the final breaths from her unkind and she is shaken 
What does this mean in love or in peace? 
With you lying next to me 
So faithless serene 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars
Alone he roams inside the ordinary catacombs of her waiting 
With raven hands she steals and staggers towards her man 
Still scorned by his demon
Because he's undone
Become the language of 
Disaster and love, vengeance and dust 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars
Dusty screams, through doors and imaginary scenes 
Of hurt and teardrop 
As he holds her down, in the cold lonely winds
Together again, her inside him 
And she calls to him 

Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
Let them cry out through your rusted scars
Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
Pick your pockets full of sorrow
Run away with me tomorrow
June 

Try, ease the pain
Somehow we'll feel the same
Well, no one knows
Where our secrets go

I send a heart to all my dearies
When your life is so, so dreary
Dream
I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream

And I fail
But when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will

Mother weep the years I'm missing
All our time can't be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
Cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
So bad

When I can, I will
Words defy the plan
When I can, I will

Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Old enough to always feel this
Always old, I'll always feel this

No more promise no more sorrow
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me
I just want to be me
When I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will
I hear your winter
And I hear your rain
But I've failed your summer ways
And I feel no pain 

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

I hear you fade away
And I hear you crawl
And I gave my life away
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel your pain

And she was my lover so sweet
And she was my angel
What I've recovered of me
I put into a box underneath my bed

When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
Lie
Lie

Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

(This take, don't give a fuck)
I hear your winter

(This take, don't give a fuck)
All hands on deck
Setting sail to get wrecked off course
You make what you want of me
I will keep you anyway

Let's fill these hours and kill desire
Let's fill these hours and kill desire
I'm in touch with you
Let's kill these hours and fill desire
Every turn is torture thought
Every kicking of the drum

I've seen the film
I know the place
I'm never lost
There's just one way across

I'm never lost

Headlights shoot north
The ends of earth off course
Of course

If you think just right
If you'll love you'll find
Certain truths left behind

All this is that once forgot
A closing down of the gate

But oh these hours
I lost my place
I'm never lost
There's just one way

There's no disgrace in failing me
Let's kill these hours and fill desire
I'm in touch with you
Let's kill these hours and fill desire
I'm in touch with you
I'm in touch with you
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright

Love can dust ya easy, as you know
And doubts make you feel slow
When shades of reason in you gone
I know, I know you'll go

Luva, you're strange
Luva, you're strange to me

I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright

Vest was in the eagle of your soul
Where's Kelly as you sung
Don't ever feel that unknown
Behold, it take home

Luva, you're strange
Luva, you're strange to me

And what do ya want me to do?
It's all gone bad
What do ya want me to say?
I'm lost like you

I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright

I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
And everywhere I go I shine bright
Alright, alright alright
Away to the side you move your head
Gravity fingers dig in your back
The strangest man won't let you breathe
Rocking on you in a movie scene

His words fill your mouth
His guests bleed sick
Devoid of touch
He lets out to the streets where you were raised
Sittin' home waiting for the coming age
You had to wait your turn
You had to wait your turn

Wake up early, wash up late
Satellites connect you to your hate
Your patience grows but your skin is thin
The pager signals they're coming in
Through the hole in the wall
You left the hole in the wall

Here's to the atom bomb
May everyone find a way to get on

A little piece of heaven is all you seek
In the same old re-run week after week
Their faces make you want to kill
The little piece of heaven singin' on the windowsill

No lights can turn you on
Pixelate the night
Reading the words
Of your eyes on the streets where you were born
Sittin' home waiting for the coming dawn
Near the hole in the wall
You left a hole in the wall
The world is a vampire, sent to drain
Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
And what do I get, for my pain?
Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game

Even though I know--I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it, for just one more show?
And what do you want? I want to change
And what have you got?
When you feel the same

Even though I know--I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son

Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son for you

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
Love
Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I'll never be
And on, and on 

I torch my soul to show the world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies

A crown of horns
An image formed deformed
The mark I've borne
A mark of scorn to you

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out the stars invite
I think I'll leave tonight

Soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what's coming down
Do you know I couldn't stay free?

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
Free, free
Free of those voices inside me
I shall be free
I shall be free
Welcome to nowhere fast
Nothing here ever lasts
Nothing but memories
Of what never was
We're nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to be
Nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to see
Living makes me sick
So sick I wish I'd die
Down in the belly of the beast
I can't lie
You're nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to be
Nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to see
There's nothing left to do
There's nothing left to feel
Doesn't matter what you want, so
To make yourself feel better
You make it so you'll never
Give in to your forevers
And live for always
And forever, forever, you're forever to be
Forever, forever, you're forever to me
God knows I'm helpless to speak on my own behalf
God is as helpless as me caught in the negatives
We all just do as we please false transmissions
I hope god forgives me for my transgressions

It's what you want to know no consequences
It's what you need to fucking bleed
It's all too much god knows I'm helpless

God know I'm restless and weak and full of piss and vinegar
God knows we sow what we reap in the dirt of grandeur
When the darkness comes to me and fixes its gaze on me
God knows I'm helpless

It's what you want to know no consequences
It's what you need to fucking bleed
It's all too much god knows I'm helpless

You break you're back for what you can't have
You can't turn back
God knows I'm helpless
By starlight I'll kiss you 
And promise to be your one and only 
I'll make you feel happy 
And leave you to be lost in mine 
And where will we go 
What will we do? 
Soon said I will know 

And are you just like me? 
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me? 
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas, yeah
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?

And all along we knew we'd carry on 
Just to belong 
By starlight I know you 
As lovely as a wish granted true 
My life has been empty, my life has been untrue 
And does she really know, who I really am? 
Does she really know me at last 
And are you just like me? 

Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas, yeah 
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?

And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Ten times removed
I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of
A wild eyed child of the sun
And right as rain  I'm not the same but
I feel the same  I feel nothing
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
I sensed my loss
Before I even learned to talk
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
I forget to forget me
I forget to forget you see
Nothing is important to me
I knew my loss
Before I even learned to speak
And all along, I knew it was wrong
But I played along, with my birthday song
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
The useless drag of another day
The endless drags of a death rock boy
Mascara sure and lipstick lost
Glitter burned by restless thoughts of being forgotten
And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Desperate and displeased with whoever you are
And you're a star
Somewhere he pulls his hair down over a frowning smile
A hidden diamond you cannot find
A secret star that cannot shine over to you
May the king of gloom, be forever doomed
And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams, of teen machines
The useless drags, the empty days
The lonely towers of long mistakes
To forgotten faces and faded loves
Sitting still was never enough
And if you're giving in, then you're giving up
'Cause in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams, of teen machines
Farther down along the range
Where the wise ones kept at bay
Those that wish secrets stay secret, for morning mass
I tell myself, 
It's where I belong
Among the waves and the dead and gone
With my ancestors drums
Here comes the morning man
He's gonna tell you where you stand
Gonna try to undertake what's falling, he's calling you
Here comes the morning man
He's here and yes he can
Penetrate the veils that you're holding, unfolding you
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la 
Sha-la-la-la 
This sign of a solstice bare
Where autumn shows its truthful air
Is when I'm vowed to empty scare 
The precious stars of morning prayers
I tell myself it's who you are
An orphan soul on a distant star
Listening for those bells

Here comes the morning man
He's here and yes he can
Penetrate the veils that you're holding, unfolding you
Here comes the morning man
He's gonna tell you where you stand
Gonna try to undertake what's falling, he's calling you
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Here comes the morning man
Sha-la-la-la
Here comes the morning man
He's watching, unfolding you
Here comes the morning man
He's watching, watching you
When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my dreaming
Dreaming is free
I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by
We just keep on dreaming
Feet feet, walking a two mile
Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream dream, even for a little while
Dream dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold
Just to have some dreaming
Dreaming is free
Innocence, innocence finds you there
Innocence, innocence doesn't care
Any way you choose
The sun, are the son
Are true
Hold me now I won't let go
Innocence, innocence let's you go
Innocence, innocence holds you down
Anyway, Anyway that you want
And you will be there
With the sun and you say you don't care
Anyway, Anyway that you want
In the love, in the love we're unsung
It's anyway, anyway that you want
Hold it in, innocence in your arms
Innocence, innocence holds you there
Innocence, innocence doesn't care
Innocence, innocence lets you dream
Innocence

Mother Moon
Mistress of the Sun
Say, I got you, I got you
Sister Sun
Lovers of the tune
Sing, I got you, I got you, I got you

Floating away, I think I'll stay
[As the view]
Floating away, I think I'll stay in blue light
Floating away, I think I'll stay
Next to you
Finding a way to make the loss in you
Cuz you don't deserve me
I know, that I deserve you

Mother Moon
Mistress of the Sun, Say,
I got you, I got you
Sister Sun
Lovers of the tune, Sing

Floating away, I think I'll stay
[as the fuse]
Floating away, I think a day with you
Floating away, I think I'll stay
Next to you
Finding a way to make the loss in you
Cuz you don't deserve me
But I deserve you
Flowers for the May Queen
But life for the prayers
If nobody wears
And what is loss, if I've got you
Wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way to reach you
Wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way to reach you
Infernal ideas
I trim the wick so fine
To carry forth your light
Comfort me
What will leave will leave
Comfort me to stem the tide
Wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way to reach you
Wildflower in the wilderness outside
take your chance with love and laughter
And every word I write, yeah
From that body will never learn
When it's far too gone I'd move on
Wasted along the way
Wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way to reach you
Wasted along the way
Wasted along the way
I'm wasted along the way to reach you

Ooh wildflower, wildfower
Ooh wildflower, wildfower
Ooh wildflower, wildfower
Ooh wildflower, wildfower
Wildflower
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
I know where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride with my best friend 

We're flying high
Watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground 

I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He promised me I'm safe in his houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again 

We're flying high
Watching the world pass us by
We're flying high
Watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to come down
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground 

See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's all right tonight
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's all right tonight
Candy cane walks down 
To build a bonfire to break my fall 
My baby, my sweet thing 
Just maybe we could lose ourselves this time 
King of the horseflies, dark prince of death 
His tragic forces are heaven sent 
In sweet things, in a lover's breath 
In knowing this was meant to be the last 
A go go go kids, a go go go style 
A suck suck suck kiss, a suck suck suck smile 
As always in young need 
A veiled promise to never die 
On dead highways, her black beauties roam 
For June angels, so far from home 
For a love lost, a faded picture 
To tread lightning, to ink the lavender skies 
So get on, get on, get on the bomb 
Get back, get back where you belong
Get on, get on, get on the bomb 
Get back, get back where you belong
Get on, get on, get on the bomb 
Get back, get back where you belong
Get on
The bomb
The lights came on fast 
Lost in motor crash 
Gone in a flash unreal 
But you knew all along 
You laugh the light 
I sing the songs 
To watch you numb 

I saw you there 
You were on your way 
You held the rain 
And for the first time 
Heaven seemed insane
Cause heaven is to blame 
For taking you away 

Do you know the way that I can? 
Do you know the way that I can't lose? 
Do you know the things that I can? 
Do you know the things that I can do? 

Where is your heart? where is your heart gone to? 
Tear me apart 
Tear me apart from you 
You laugh the light I cry the wound 
In gray afternoons 

I saw you there 
You were on your way 
You held the rain 
And for the first time 
Heaven seemed insane
Cause heaven is to blame 
For taking you away 

The lights came to pass 
Dead opera motor crash 
Gone in a flash unreal 
In nitrous overcast 

Do you know the way that I can? 
Do you know the way that I can't choose? 
Do you know the things that I can? 
Do you know the things that I can't lose? 

Tear me apart 
Tear me apart from you 
Where is your heart? 
Where has your heart run to?
When I passed you in the doorway 
You took me with a glance
Should have took that last bus home 
But I asked you for a dance 
Now we were steady to the pictures 
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
Father says "he's going crazy" 
Says I'm livin' in a trance, 
Dancing in the moonlight 
It's caught me in it's spotlight, 
It's alright, it's alright, the moonlight 
This long, hot summer night 
It's three o'clock in the morning, I'm on the streets again
Disobeyed another warning, shoulda been home by ten 
Now I stay out 'till Sunday, I have to say I stayed with friends 
It's a habit worth forming, It's a means to justify the end 
Dancing in the moonlight 
It's caught me in it's spotlight, 
It's alright, it's alright, the moonlight 
This long, hot summer night 
I'm walking home 
Last bus is long gone
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out 

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've never known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings
Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Bonjour!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Bonjour!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Bonjour!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

What's our mission
Do we know
But never listen
For too long
They held me under
But I hear
It's almost over
In Detroit
On a Memphis train
Like you said it's
Down in the heat and the summer rain of
The automatic gauze of your memories
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
Try to hold on
To this heart
A little bit longer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
For this heart's
A little bit colder
Try to hold on
To this love
Paperback scrawl your hidden poems
Written around the dried out flowers
Here we are still trading places
To try to hold on
Pop tart
Can you envision
A free world
Of clear division
For too long
They held us under
But I know
We're getting over
In Detroit
With the Nashville tears
Like you said it's
Down in the heat with the broken numbers
Down in the gaze of solemnity
Down in the way you've held together
To try to hold on
To this heart
A little bit closer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
For this heart's
A little bit older
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
And we are still alive
Try to hold on
And we have survived
Try to hold on
And no one should deny
We tried to hold onto the pulse of the feedback current
Into the flow of encrypted movement
Slapback kills the ancient remnants
That try to hold on
Try to hold on
To this heart alive
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
And we are still alive
Try to hold on
And we have survived
Try to hold on
Pop tart
You never listen
Skinned knees
Try to hold on
Stop start
What's our mission
Skinned knees
Try to hold on
I know that we are young.
And I know you may love me.
But I just can't be with you like this anymore.
Glissandra.

She's got both hands
in her pocket.
And she won't look at you,
Won't look at you

She hides true love
En su bolsillo.
She's got a halo 'around her finger.
Around you.

You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose.

Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarrette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.

Glissandra.
Glissandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
(Just stop. Please. Just let me go. Glissandra. Just let me go.)

She's not broken,
She's just a baby.
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad.
and all those flames that burned before him.
Now he's gonna fight your fight, gonna cool the bad.

You know that I love you boy.
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I gotta choose,
nothing to loose

Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.


Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.

Glissandra.
Glissandra.
Gle-ny-sandra.
Gle-ny-sandra. [2x]

Don't bother me.
Don't bother me. Glissandra
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Starla.

I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Glissandra.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch. Starla.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Glissandra.
I'm not your babe.
I'm not your babe, Starla.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch.
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name.
Don't call my name, Tristessa.
My reflection dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself 
I'm your lover  I'm your zero 
I'm the face in your dreams of glass 
So save your prayers 
For when you're really gonna need 'em 
Throw out your cares and fly 
Want to go for a ride? 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 

Emptiness is loneliness  and loneliness is cleanliness 
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me 
Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms 
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth 

I never let on, that I was on a sinking ship 
I never let on that I was down 
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore 
You blame yourself for wanting more 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 
She's my one and only
I don't mind what you're running
'Cause you and me we're just something
Don't just hang what you're running on
I don't mind the sound alone

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

Let's get heat and we living
Don't ya hide what you're getting
Don't ya want all the ones that stall
Don't ya mind, if it's me at all
One and all

I just say when you love him
'Cause you and me we are running
Baby sweet, are we rust in cuffs
I don't save for rainy days

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

One and all
We are, we are so young
We're young, we're young

Can't just care what you're doing
Me and you, we're just ruined
Just but cheat for the morning's traum
Don't ya mind, if it's me at all
If it's me at all, if it's me at all

I don't mind a thing or two
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all
We are, we are so young
One and all
Hiding behind my hair today
My eyes dance with fire
The thought of living here
And the bounds I transpire
Walking in this slow-motion now
I think you've made so bad 
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath 
The grave that bears my name
Started a dream
A dream, immortality
Yet I fall in vain 
Just as long as I don't breathe
I'll never be like them 
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath 
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart
Hiding behind my hair today
Wishing I was far away
Walking in this slow-motion town
I seem to be so bad 
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath 
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart 
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
If you go and I would stay
You would call my name
I would die, yes, I would die
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart
My heart
Anyone can see
You're laughing down at me
It's easy for you now
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm  you know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 

Now you know where I've been 
As you sleep shine I am 
Waiting down patiently 
Born of love 

You know I'm  you know I'm not dead 
I'm just living in my head 
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire 
You always find your way 

And through it all  into us all you move 
Forgotten touch, forbidden thought 
We can never, ever know 

You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm, you know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 

Down below the creatures scream
Strangehold of God's machines
Begging to tear us out 
Torn is hope 

You know I'm, you know I'm not dead 
I'm just the tears inside your head 
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire 
You always find a way 

And through it all, into us all you move 
Forgotten touch, forbidden thought 
We can never, ever know 
You know I'm not dead 

We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze 
Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway 
But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog 
The fickle fascination of an everlasting God 

You know I'm not dead 
I'm just living in my head 

Forever waiting, forever waiting a cruel death 

You know I'm not dead 
I'm just living for myself
Forever waiting 

You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead

My daydream seems as one inside of you
Though it seems hard to reach through this life
Your blue and hopeless life 

My daydream screams bitter 'til the end
The love I share -true- selfish to the heart
My heart, my sacred heart

My daydream dream
My daydream
My daydream dream
My daydream

I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I don't want feelings
Your feelings

I have gone crazy
Motherfucking crazy
I have gone
This is the song I've been singing my whole life 
I've been waiting like a knife 
To cut open your heart 
And bleed my soul into you 
I did it all for you 
You and you and you and you 

This is the sound I've been making my whole life 
I've been waiting for this night 
To clear up all the talk 
Although I'm selfish to a fault 
Is it selfish it's you I want? 
You  I did it all for you 

This love will stand as long as you 
There's really no excuse 
I did it all for you 

These are the tears I've been crying my whole life 
Like an ocean of desire 
I'm reaching through the noise
Across the dusk of time 
Within the lilting lies 
I am singing out to you
Gone, long gone
We can all be gone, gone, gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Leave it far behind
And although my secret's gone
I'll try to carry on
If I must, I'll get along without you
Gone, long gone
Leave this world all wrong, wrong, wrong
Beyond the pale and dawn
Free these mortal bonds
No one knows I can't be wrong
Still l sing the same old song
I tried to be strong for you
Why have you left me?
Amongst the tall trees
I know I gave her all I had
And I tied her heart in ribbons
And I tied her heart in ribbons
I tied her heart in ribbons and bows
And I'm gone
Oh yes, I'm gone
And I'm lost without you
I'm lost within you
And I'm gone, so gone, long gone
To my mistakes  to my mistakes of cowardice
She shimmy shakes  the Jimmy Jakes of consequence
Born of the airs and dues  my airs of madness do declare
That it's o.k.  it's love
It's what you wanted to see  it's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need  she'll make it up
Love  it's who you know
Machine gun blues  her vacant rush is so steel
I'm unaware  lost inside your visions
I got mine too over, I got mine and I got you
'Cause I know you, you're love
It's what you wanted to see, it's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need, she'll make it up
Love, it's who you know
When I lost my mind, I knew I was in for a long time
Can I look up to you as you look down on me
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be
For what I needed to need, she'll make it
Love, it's who you know
As far as you take me
That's where I believe
The realm of soft delusions
Floating on the leaves
On a distant shoreline
She waves her arms to me
As all the thought police
Are closing in for sleep
The dilly dally
Of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes
Has given me the power to be afraid
And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

I'm beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you

In the slipstream
Of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good
The light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly
I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations
With filth and disease
Porcelina
She waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

And in my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone of you
You make it right
It's all alright
You make it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Is everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed?
They're running towards their holes to find out
Apocalyptic thieves
Are lost amongst our dead
A message to our friends, to get out

There's wagers on this fear
Oh, oh, so clear
Depends on what you'll pay to hear

They're bound to kill us all
In white-washed halls
The jackals lick their paws

Please don't stop
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days
Will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
Tickin' in my heart, not broken

I love life everyday, each and every way
Kafka would be proud to find out
I'm certain of the end; it's the means that has me spooked
It takes an unknown truth to get out
I guess that I'm born free, c'est la vi
I was meant to beg from my knees
Please, don't stop
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days
Will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
Tickin' in my heart
These lonely days, will they ever stop?

Gotta dig in
Gas mask's on
Wait in the sunshine overhead
If this is living, sakes alive
Well, then, we can't win, no one survives

Is everyone afraid?
You should be ashamed
Apocalyptic screams mean nothing to the dead
Kiss your little son to know all there is
C'mon, last call!
You should want it all!

It's lonely at the top
These lonely days, will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock
These lonely days, will they ever stop?
It's tickin' in my heart
Is everyone afraid?
We'll wander off through the dead of night
Past wastelands of shattered souls
Warm by my firelight
I peer into the darkness alone

As the Indian summer of my remembrance
Settles on my bones
Cracked and weary, I ask for direction home

Home, let the word spill from my mouth
Love, love is everything I want
I'm one of many more to come
Love, love is everything I want

Crossroads outside of town
The heartbroken faces shine
The city lights so far and dull
Turning left I know it's time

With an urgent wind upon my rolling heals
To carry me along
My face downcast, I turn to ruins past and home

Home, let the word spill from my mouth
Love, love is everything I want
I'm one of many more to come
Love, love is everything I want

We'll wander off through the dead of night
Past terrors and broken homes
Wipe the sleep from under your eyes
Of riverbanks and catacombs
Sleep into the bee and the sea
I was to live this life alone
Lay down Caligula
Cry out, I know it's time

Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
Love is everything I want
And I stumbled onto you
As you stumbled over me
And you say the fates were cruel
For throwing us together
I always loved you so
Especially when you'd go
All the world must know
That I loved you so

Its a pity we're apart
Its a shame you broke my heart
But I've got a new girlfriend
She looks a lot like you dear
No one could ever do dear
All the world must know
That I loved you so
Especially when you'd go
Especially when you'd go away and leave me here
Go away and leave me alone
All the world must know

Pennies for sale
Pledged your faith
My heart embraced
Struggle to renew
Blurry mind
So hypnotized
Fast enough who

Wonder where you are
Tristessa

Soul takes soul
As I take eye
I will wait for you

Hang on to your life
Tristessa

I love you true
Surely I do
I love you true
Surely I do
Surely I do
Surely I do (no)

Do you ever wake up and find yourself alone?
Do you ever wake far from home?
What you believe
You'll wish to receive
I won't believe in you
Tristessa
Tristessa
Tristessa
Hey blue, all your love is strange
Come out with all those crazy names
So true when you lie
For you, blue 

Right or wrong
I belong
Right or wrong

Hey blue, where'd you run to now?
Miss you since they found you out
I've been waiting such a long time
For your smile, for you

I lay with you this velvet morning
Stay with me for a while
Where we run to is up to you
Just stay with me for a while
Last chance to make believe in always and all it seems
Train wrecks hide underneath your umbrella
Set the frame destiny on this first name soliloquy
Tired symphonies play downward

Let me give the world to you my love
Let me give the world to you my love
Let me show you what I'm thinking of
Let me give the world to you my love

So far
So far
So far

Lovers form dead excuse
And blur the line with soul abuse
My lonesome lines just have no use around here

New skin may hold you in
But the old skin still turns us on
Flicker fades the nitrate dawn to wear

Let me give the world to you my love
Let me show you what I'm thinking of
Times are hard and we're the last in line
'Cause in my grief I'd forgotten what was mine

No I wouldn't change a thing
No I, no
No I wouldn't change a thing about the way you are
The distance here, the speed so far
So far
So far
So far

Let me give the world to you my love
Let me give the world to you my love
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you
Let me give the world to you my love

So far
So far
So far
Low, low, so low with you
Go, go, I'll go with you
With you

Take, take me somewhere
Wake me, dream somewhere

And you're peelin' back your eyes
Some disguise
Trouble you just can't hide
And you're feeling so low, so

I'll wait with you
I'll wait with you
The sun has blessed
The rays are gone
And all the kids have left their tears and gone home

Sweet 17, sour 29
And I can't explain myself
What I'd hoped to find
You were all so kind
Without her here

And if you're still feeling down
Then maybe you need me around
To love and hold you
Don't say i hadn't told you so
Maybe you need me around

I had no luck
I had no shame
I had no cause, just seventeen days of rain
And you in my eyes

Just one more song to slay this earth
And I can't explain myself just what it's worth
It was all I had, but not all I'd need
And I can't escape the fact that I still bleed

And if you're still feeling down
And if this seems way too loud
Then maybe you need me around

I had no voice
I had no drive
I had no choice
I've done my time
I had myself
Had my band
I had my love
Had no hand in watching it all fall apart

And if you're still feeling down
Then maybe you need me around
To lift and scold you
To send you crashing all right now
Maybe you need me around
Born of love and cast in light
Don't you know we cannot die

We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are

The stars above, stars of grace
Shining down what's left of face
You hurt so bad
This knowing, this fallacy
I want so much
To follow as I lead

For love I keep
Silent I weep
Dead suns rule dead air
But Heaven is everywhere
Stars...

Torn from God and flung towards night
Don't you want what I can't fight

We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are
We are stars
We are

The stars that shine, stars that bleed
Silver seeking destiny
So follow please
This hurts so much
This knowing carries me
We want so bad
We forget we are free
Spirit smile on
Deep black diamond
So rise the lost toys
Island of white noise
And purple haze

We are starz
We are starz
We are starz

What hurts so much
Is knowing we are free!
Say goodbye on a night like this 
If it's the last thing we ever do 
You never looked as lost as this 
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you 
It goes dark 
It goes darker still
Please stay 
But I watch you like I'm made of stone 
As you walk away 
I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night 
A witch hunt for another girl 
For always and ever is always for you 
Your trust 
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world 
Say hello on a day like today 
Say it every time you move 
The way that you look at me now 
Makes me wish I was you 
It goes deep 
It goes deeper still 
This touch 
And the smile and the shake of your head 
I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night 
Can't stand here like this anymore 
For always and ever is always for you 
I want it to be perfect 
Like before 
I want to change it all 
I want to change
Nothing left to say
And all I've left to do
Is run away
From you
She led me on, down
With secrets I can't keep 

Close your eyes and sleep
Don't wait up for me
Hush now don't you speak
To me

Wrapped my hurt in you
And took my shelter in that pain
The opiate of blame
Is your broken heart, your heart

So now I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
I'll betray my tears
To anyone caught in our ruse of fools

One last kiss from me yeah
One last kiss good night

Didn't want to lose you once again
Didn't want to be your friend
Fulfilled a promise made of tin
Crawled back to you

I'm all by myself (close your eyes)
As I've always felt
?
I'll betray myself
To anyone, lost, anyone but you

So let the sadness come again
On that you can depend on me, yeah
Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah
When god sleeps in bliss

And I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
And I'll betray myself
To anyone
Hey blue, all your love is strange
Come out with all those crazy names
So true when you lie
For you, blue 

Right or wrong
I belong
Right or wrong

Hey blue, where'd you run to now?
Miss you since they found you out
I've been waiting such a long time
For your smile, for you

I lay with you this velvet morning
Stay with me for a while
Where we run to is up to you
Just stay with me for a while
Lost your head, now you sleep on the floor
What you said, I don't want anymore
Through the haze, make your eyes up to ache
Out in space, days away 

Through these eyes
I rely on all I've seen
Obscured
Through these eyes
It looks like I'm home tonight

Left for dead as you sweep out the cold
Things we said we don't need anymore
Tale inside her like a fallen kite
Hey, hey, yeah

Through these eyes
I deny on all I see
Obscured
Through these eyes
It looks like I'm home tonight

What you said made a mess of me
What you said, I don't want
Obscured
All that you suffer is all that you are
All that you smother is all that you are
And you're saying you're seeing, you're saying who you are
What takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are 

All may say
I will dream
All may say

All your struggles beneath your disguise
Drink from the reasons that hold you alive
'Til we're safe from the wounds of desire and pain
You must rise from the mounds of desire and change

Too late to discover peace of mind
Too late to recover me

All you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be
Taken down your only son and what he means to me
Your dream will be
To dream with me

Will you wait? Yes I will, I will wait for you
To cleanse your life takes more than time
Take what you want
Take all of it

Too late to discover peace of mind (have no peace of mind)
Too late to recover
I want to live for God and country
I want to give for God and country

It's too late for some
It's too late for what you've done
I can't help what I divide in you

For God and country I'll fight
For God and country I'll die
For God and country my soul is so alive
My soul is so alive
Lay down your arms to me
Lay down your arms for God and country

I want to live where no one's watching my way home
I want to give until I'm bursting with unknown

It's too late for some
It's too late for everyone
I can't help what I destroy in you

Well who needs this anymore?
C'mon make it so
That's when they build their cross of death
You won't build your own

It's time to wake up!
It's time to wake up for good
I can't help you though I should

For God and country we'll fight
For God and country we'll die
For God and country my soul is so alive
My soul is so alive
Lay down your arms to me
Lay down your arms for God and country

You can't deny God and country
We're fighting for our lives
You can't deny God and country
Our souls are so aligned
In this time of God and country
We'll take you on our side
It's alright

My soul is so alive
With God and night
With God and country
My soul is so alive
She always waits for someone
Someone who'll never leave
Reliving her decision
Her arms cover me

My couple, no one
To anyone believe
She always waits for someone
Someone, someone just like me

Jennifer
Jennifer Ever
Jennifer
Jennifer always tells me
Please don't be afraid
I only want to hold you
I only want you to stay

She always waits for someone
Someone, someone just like me

Lonely draw
Sides grow dimmer
Spellbound all
I waste the hour
My love is winter
My love is lost

Silent fog
Lets pass and wither
From the cold that saws me flat
My love is winter
My love is lost

There is love enough for the both of us
There is more than prayers made
To be with you
My love is lost

My love is winter
My love is lost
My love is winter
There is love enough for the both of us
There are more than prayers of you

Sacred hold in my mirror
Were you told there is no rest?
My love is winter
My love is lost

There is love enough for the both of us
There is love enough
There is love
There is love enough for the both of us
There is love enough
There is love
There is love, love, love
Fall into the century on a supersonic cross
Blessed she in aching silence, eternal loss
Calling out I won't surrender a locket of her hair
Sympathize her pious pleasures, go down the stairs
Into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for

Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love

Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow

Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it ours
Or is it what we're seekin'
Real love

In the eyes, behold and you'll find the 21st century
You detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow, the rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow

Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love

We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of a fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless

Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

Real love
She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors
And I said, I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, another one should come to one another
No one should come between us
Still I was lonely, and she was by my side, my one and only
Knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game
'Cause I was lonely and she was crazy
Rat-tat-tat, ka boom boom, now take that, and just a bit of this
'Cause I'm a watcher, and I'm a doer of none
Come to save you, 'cause you're all mine

I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine
Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss
'Cause I'm a sister, and I'm a motherfuck
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, no one should ever come
In between us, between us and our love

Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went I was sure to go
Now Mary's got a problem, and Mary's not a stupid girl
Mary's got some deep shit, and Mary does not forget
And this is how Mary's garden grows, and this is how Mary has her ghosts
And into the eyes of the jackal I say ka-boom
Now we begin descent, to where we've never been
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
And she will never learn
She will never learn
Bye bye, baby goodbye, bye, bye
Bye June 
I'm going to the moon 
It better be by June 
'Cause I'm going to the moon 
So June 
You'd better make it soon 
I hope you make it June 
'Cause I'm going to the moon 
Bye June 
Bye June 
I'm going to the moon 
I hope you make it soon 
'Cause I'm waiting on this moon 
Bye June 
I hope you make it too 
I'm wishing you're there too 
I hope you make it June 
Bye bye June
Faith lies in
The ways of sin
Chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore 

And in their eyes I was alive
Fool's disguise
Take me away from you

Shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I'd ever been

When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew, revive
It's alright honey
It's alright, yeah

Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel OK?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you
Yeah, I love you, it's true

Life's a bummer
When you're a hummer
Life's a drag

Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free

Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free

Do you feel
Love is real
I know we're just like old friends 
We just can't pretend 
That lovers make amends 
We are reasons so unreal 
We can't help but feel that something has been lost 

But please you know you're just like me 
Next time I promise we'll be 
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line 
Lovers out of time 
Memories unwind 

So far I still know who you are 
But now I wonder who I was... 

Angel, you know it's not the end 
We'll always be good friends 
The letters have been sent on 

So please, you always were so free 
You'll see, I promise we'll be 
Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet 
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we sleep
Perfect 
You know this has to be 
We always we're so free 
We promised that we'd be 
Perfect
Sleep will not come to this tired body now 
Peace will not come to this lonely heart
There are some things I'll live without 
But I want you to know that I need you right now 
I need you tonight 

I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves 
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes 
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me 
I need someone to ease my mind 
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find 

And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight 
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright 
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight 
'Cause I want you to stay, with me 

I need you tonight 
She comes to me like an angel out of time 
As I play the part of a saint on my knees
There are some things I'll live without 
But I want you to know that I need you right now 
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire for you

Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire for you

For you
For you
The stars are out tonight
And what you need of me youve got inside you
Just take me home, take me home dont fight
But drive me home the wrong way
No loss spared
For losing you aint right
You haunt where
Spritis take their time
Its time I cant seem to fight
The stars are out for us
And what you feel for me rides beside you
Just take me home, take me home
Dont fuss
But drive me home the right way

Well uncover theres no other faith but us
A faith in love unseen
Trace the face of love unseen
Dont shadow up what we mean
Uncover what were meant to be
And come unlace your light
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonight
Amphetamine Annie-dog 
Has her leash and a face 
Her velvet spleen her shackle spine 
Her diamond curse 
It comes with mine 

A vessel she 
For violent I 
Confession arms a wake 
Mine, mine you were always mine 
Possessed by my taste 

And below the angel dog 
Combs her hair and sings her psalms 
The bombs go off 
She doesn't notice 
It all goes wrong 
She sets things tragic 
She is Venus 
She is mars 
She's electric 
And the struggle of 

Upon my face we leave no trace 
But in her stomach mercury aged 

She holds the blood 
She carves the knives 
She digs the wives in our babies
Amphetamine Annie-dog 
Pulls her trash 
And her stories 
From place to place 
And bed to bed 
Gives of herself and the magnet head 

Another floor another ceiling
Counting stairs with double meanings 

Is it wrong to be swallowed whole 
To disappear in her 
To give her the priceless peace 
Of giving up control 

We tumble out into the streets 
And Annie-dog she drags her leash
Pretty face 
Ugly mouth
Bitter bred and so released 

And by the no 
And by the yes 
Annie goes if you couldn't guess 

A simple man 
A sycophant 
Her elephant with the laughing call 
She wants clean sheets 
And fresh flowers 
And dental shots 
And the Hong Kong glue 

Amphetamine Annie-dog 
Has her leash and a face
This time I need to know 
I really must be told 
If it's over 
It's up to you  you know 
The things you want to hold 
Are in pieces
Crashing down 
Crashing down again
Crashing down 
Crashing down  my friends 

I've got to move it on 
I've got to sing my song 
While I still can 
Dispatch the last alarms 
Hand out the last few charms
There's no surprises 

Only love  yeah 
Only love can win 
Crashing down 
Crashing down, my friends 

This time I need to know 
I really must be told 
That it's over 
I've lived my life alone 
My every step foretold 
To never linger 
And yet it haunts me so 
What we are letting go 
Our spell is broken
Crashing down 
Crashing down, my friends
Crashing down 
Crashing down again 
Only love, yeah 
Only love will be enough 
Yeah, only love will win 

For every chemical 
You trade a piece of your soul 
With no return 
And who you think you know 
Doesn't know you at all 
Their drain is needless
Someday we'll wave hello 
And wish we'd never waved goodbye 
To this romance 
We'll drink up every line 
And shoot up every word 
Till there's no more 

Crashing down 
Crashing down, my friends 
Only love 
Only love can win 

So cry these tears 
We'll cry as all 
We've held so long to fall apart 
As the curtain falls 
We bid you all goodnight
I lie, I wait
I stop, I hesitate
I am, I breathe
I meant, I think of me 

Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough

I taste, I love
I come, I bleed enough
I hate, I'm not
I was, I want too much

Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
Bury me in love
Bury me in love 

Shared your kisses, take your heart
Buried me and it hurts

I love my sister so
She don't smother me
I played the spades I know
I'm a jack of all trades
Would you bury me?

Once you see her
One inside (hide, hide)
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her
Tell me why (why, why)
Why won't she come outside?

Once you see her
One inside (hide, hide)
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her
Tell me why (why, why)
Why won't she come outside?

She will bury me
She will bury me
Ten times removed 
I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of 
A wild eyed child of the sun 
And right as rain  I'm not the same but 
I feel the same  I feel nothing
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends 
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again 
I sensed my loss 
Before I even learned to talk 
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back 
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends 
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again 
I forget to forget me 
I forget to forget you see 
Nothing is important to me 
I knew my loss 
Before I even learned to speak 
And all along, I knew it was wrong 
But I played along, with my birthday song 
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends 
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
Kiss and kill me sweetly 
Come and drive me home 
Drag the miles in me 
I am yours alone
Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into you 

Desire me so deeply
Drain and kick me hard 
Whisper secrets for me 
Try to go too far 

Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into... 

Please don't change
Please don't change at all 
Bring your rain 
Bring your rain to fall 

Inside where it's warm 
Wrap myself in you 
Outside where I'm torn 
Fight myself in two 
In two 
Into you 

Come and kiss me sweetly 
Ride the telephone 
Drag the miles to me 
I am yours alone
Yours alone 
On the telephone
Yours alone
Looking for a kiss kiss 
Yours alone
Dad
Dead
Was I ever alive?
Fucking makes you alive in one minute
Solctice
I am solctice filled with mercury
Liquid fucked
See right through your heart
Fuck your heart
I am mercury liquid pure
Hot, alive, dead, mucked fish eyes, doe eyes
I was born alive
I'll fucking kill you
I'll beat your soft baby head with my own hand
Careful with that baby...
Don't ever say the h word around him
Ashamed
I am ashamed of my name
Say it
I hate the sound of your shit because it means no good
It means cheap, liar, smart ass piece of shit
Change it to ray gun you fuck
Billy is the loon
I am the loon
I am mars
Billy addly addly addly...
Your name causes shit
While I may be no expert on this reality,
There is no god, but shame
God is hurt, god is cold
Try that once, god is dead
There is not another one
Battle
Cold heart radio
Feedback
The pain
Recurring messages of badness
Recurring living bad dreams at the vortex of lost souls
Wailing lost souls of shame
We are in one hole
Like a cup of mercury phosphate
Brrr
Shuddering around
Taste my shit you wench
Lifting, wailing lost souls who stand a chance
Hot, my eyes darkly gaze and wonder
Do not enter
Why?
I was born whole
Fractured, divided, shattered into a billion fragments
A million piece puzzle
A million piece jigsaw puzzle with no this, and no that
Shot down I stood
Withstood my neighborhood
I got it wrong
But I could
Follow love lest I learn
It's light
To bring the light
I fought with all my might, with light
Oh bring the light
Light, bring the light I never felt so good and right but tonight you'll never need another sound
Oh, bring the light
Bring the light to me

Here and gone oh I trust
You'd spit upon my dust
And mix my ash with your blood
A son of God you know you must arrive
In the light
Bring the light, let's bring the light
Light, oh bring the light
Light, bring the light
It's yours not mine
If you just want to survive
Go grab a glimpse of any star in heaven's high
I never felt so real and loved and alive
No shadows follow me unsung
In the light, bring the light to me

A flower song, clear and bright
Is it wrong, in neon white?
To insist you are mine
Standing dumb in the light
Bring the light
Oh, bring the light
Bring the light!

Light, bring the light
I never felt so real and right and alive
Don't let them steal from you what's yours by right
Light, bring the light
You know there comes a place and time
You can't deny
With every movement shadows cast and align
Bring the light, bring the light
Bring the light let's bring the light
Light, bring the light
Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it, to see

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of sound
As you can see there's no one around
Cast the pearls aside of a simple life of need 
Come into my life forever 
The crumbled cities stand as known 
Of the sights you have been shown 
Of the hurt you call your own 
You know, you know
Love is suicide, love is suicide
Love is suicide, love is suicide

The empty bodies stand at rest 
Casualties of their own flesh
Afflicted by their dispossession 
But nobody's ever knew 
Nobody's 
Nobody's felt like you 
Nobody's 
Love is suicide, love is suicide
Love is suicide, love is, ah

Now we drive the night, to the ironies of peace 
You can't help deny forever 
The tragedies reside in you 
The secret sights hide in you 
The lonely nights divide you in two, in two, in two
All my blisters now revealed 
In the darkness of my dreams 
In the spaces in between us 
But nobody's ever knew 
Nobody's 
Nobody's felt like you 
Nobody's 
Nobody's ever knew 
Nobody's 
Nobody's felt like you 
Nobody's 

Love is suicide, love is suicide
Love is suicide, love is suicide
Tired eyes
Closed for days
There's no regret
'Cause there's no place
I don't know
What I believe
But if I feel safe
What do I need

A home
A home
A home

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do to me
What will they do to me
What will they do to me
What will they do to me

Dulcet tongues
Whisper fast
The future yearns
Right now's the past
Rouse me soon
The end draws nigh
Who's side are you on
Your blood you cannot buy

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution blues
What will they do to you

Well I
I feel alright
So tonight
I got to ask you why
Why deny it
It's no surprise
I've got to survive
Freedom shines the light ahead
I'll lead the last charge to bed
I said my last rights
I don?t have to run scared no more

Fight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight a revolution
Tonight
I wanna fight
I wanna fight a revolution
Tonight
At the light
At the light
Do you wanna watch me die

Let me be something good
Let me prove something real like I should
Let me embrace every single living thing
Let me be every single moment I ever misunderstood
And I'd love you to notice
I'm devoted
To destroy for no one
Now it's that time again to take revenge
On all the debutantes and their friends
The bitter charlemagnes so self-absorbed
The bodily remains such a bore

Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah

And all I see is empty
'Cause now I'm one of them
So adored
The slink of impotence
That money can afford
We know who you are and where you live
Is your innocence all that you can give

Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah

In the back of the car
The angel dust was given back to the stars

Hey, yeah
Was I good enough to break you
Hey, yeah

And in this fall from grace
We'll meet again
Another time another place
I've been down deep in you and me
Let's see where we can go
Yeah yeah yeah
Angels, Barbe
My reflection dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself 
I'm your lover  I'm your zero 
I'm the face in your dreams of glass 
So save your prayers 
For when you're really gonna need 'em 
Throw out your cares and fly 
Want to go for a ride? 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 

Emptiness is loneliness  and loneliness is cleanliness 
And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me 
Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms 
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth 

I never let on, that I was on a sinking ship 
I never let on that I was down 
You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore 
You blame yourself for wanting more 

She's the one for me 
She's all I really need, oh yeah
She's the one for me 
She's my one and only
I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit

I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me

And you're mistaken, it's you that's faking
Living and breathing and dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool

You can't bring me back, you can't bring me back
'Cause I gave it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks
Wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole

Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make me so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect

To runaround kids in get-go cars
With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Giving us the farewell runarounds
I took a virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no good girl 
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth

And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
For you
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it, so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way to disconnect, yeah
If I were alive 
If I were real 
Would you survive? 
What would you feel? 

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine 
As sentimental as our broken dreams 

Let me die for rock and roll 
Let me die to save my soul 
Let me die  let me die  rock and roll 
Let the world forgive the past 
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last 
Let me go  let me go  rock and roll 

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, a heavy metal machine 
We're the metal in their metal machines
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine 

If I were dead 
Would my records sell? 
Could you even tell? 
Is it just as well? 

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine 
It's elemental to all the rust it brings
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine 

Let me die for rock and roll 
Let me die to save my soul 
Let me die, let me die, rock and roll 
Let the world forgive the past 
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last 
Let me go, let me go, rock and roll 

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, a heavy metal machine 
We're the metal in their droning schemes
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine 

Will I survive? 
Is it up to me? 
Could you understand 
That it's not yours to keep? 

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
And if there is a God
I know he likes to rock
He likes his loud guitars
His spiders from Mars
And if there is a God 
I know he's watching me
He likes what he sees
But there's trouble on the breeze

Who are you this time?
Are you one of us, flying blind?
'Cause we're down here throwing stones
While you're so far from home

And if there is a God
And if there is a God
He's a spy with bedroom eyes
Who cowers in our skies

Who are you this time?
Are you one of us, flying blind?
'Cause we're down here throwing stones
While you're so far from home

If there is a God
If there is a God
Love
Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I'll never be
And on, and on 

I torch my soul to show the world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies

A crown of horns
An image formed deformed
The mark I've borne
A mark of scorn to you

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out the stars invite
I think I'll leave tonight

Soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what's coming down
Do you know I couldn't stay free?

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
Free, free
Free of those voices inside me
I shall be free
I shall be free
Planned a show
Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow
See you in June 

Could have known
I would reveal
Should have known
I would conceal your way

She knows, she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows, she knows
How's it
She knows, she knows, she knows
Colors show
After the moon
I should go
See you in June
Your way

Open your eyes
To these must I lie?
The world is a vampire, sent to drain
Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
And what do I get, for my pain?
Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game

Even though I know--I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it, for just one more show?
And what do you want? I want to change
And what have you got?
When you feel the same

Even though I know--I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold-like old job

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son

Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son for you

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
I lay my head on her bosom
To cry myself to sleep
I see no greater wisdom
Than she has given me 

La dolly vita
Sweet as true love
La dolly vita
Cool as ice cream
Cool as ice cream

You hear a lot of visions
You can't even stop
Can't see what you're missing
Spinning like a top

Fade away, I want to see her
Fade away, I want to see her
I only want to meet her

La dolly vita
True as blue sky
La dolly vita
Cool as ice cream
Cool as ice cream

Take it all the way down
Forsake what you have now
Take it all the way down
I said I would get over you
Now I'm here out on my own
Trying to live my life
And now you wanna come back
But I don't need no brand new lies, listen up

I want a love that's serious
No time to play love games
I don't wanna be nobody's fool
So if you wanna be with me
You gotta give it up

Real love
I know I wanna have one
Real love
Gonna try and get some

Real love
Everybody needs one
Real love
Got to have real love

All my friends are telling me
I should give you another try
But I don't need opinions
To deal with what I have on my mind, listen up

I want a love that's serious
No time to play love games
I don't wanna be nobody's fool
So if you wanna be with me
You gotta give it up

Real love
I know I wanna have one

Real love
Oh yeah, another day
Oh yeah, gotta play
What it is, it never was
I don't care to give enough 

My boredom has out shined the sun
It's all down low
I just want to have some
Little fun

Oh yeah, another day
Oh yeah, what a waste
What it is, It never was
I don't care or give a fuck

My boredom has out shined the sun
It's all down low
I just want to have some
Little fun

Bring me down
Bring me down
When I was born I lost
When I was freed I fought
Now that I'm loved I'm caught
Between the rest and this tragic mess
An invited guest

Torn, broken and frayed
Oh don't we face
War, sunshine and grace
Oh won't you stay
For a while
We can fail in style
I can hold your smile
For a while

What was once new now gone
What was once praised now wrong
As they go, we can say we know
But what do we know
But warm sunshine and graves
Don't we see
What's bitter to taste

Torn, broken and frayed
Don't we face
War, sunshine and graves
Won't you stay

'Cause I won't tell
I won't tell a soul
That I'm mad as hell
Torn, broken and frayed
I'm torn, broken and frayed
No, I'm cold, worn out and shamed
So here we are 
True superstars 
We're so real from afar and now 
Now you're with us now 
And the mouths of babes sing revolution 
And the mouths of babes scream disillusion 
You can't break what's already broken 
'Cause from the mouths of babes comes nothing 
The "dream" was a sham 
For saving what you can't 
And now they're me but I'm not them 
I am you and you are me 
It's in the ways I walk through fire 
It's in the ways of my desire 
And when I said that you're no good 
What I meant was I wish you could 
Be there forever 
Be young forever 
I wish you were there 
So now I bid farewell
Beyond the bounds of hell 
And now you'll swear you knew us well 
Well you can never tell 
And the mouths of babes sing revolution 
And the mouths of babes scream disillusion 
You can't break what's already broken 
'Cause from the mouths of babes comes nothing
The clever make the world weary
To pull it from its moorings
To fawn the young wicked roost
To weather the coming storms

They are inside now
They are inside
They are inside now
Saturnine

How I love to waste your time
Saturnine
Saturnine
Goodbye all you widows
Tearstained underneath
Blessed to the many
Who are seeking some relief

They are inside
They are inside now
They are inside
They are inside
You'll always run
But you cannot find
Saturnine
Saturnine
Saturnine
You were waiting all this time
Saturnine
Saturnine
Camera take this picture
The wreckage is outside
Quick may you hurry
We are losing our light

We are inside now
We are inside
We are inside
You'll always run
But you'll never find
Saturnine
Saturnine
How I'd love to make you mine
Saturnine
Saturnine

To the ages I am speaking
To the creatures I am sky
Bloody simple features
Everyone chooses sides
Shatter this faith broken
Walk these summer miles
Leave here while forgotten
Carrying forth this child
Saturnine
You're gonna walk on home 
You're gonna walk alone 
You're gonna see this through 
Don't let them get to you 

Shame 

Love is good and love is kind 
Love is drunk and love is blind 
Love is good and love is mine 
Love is drunk all the time 

Shame 

You're gonna walk on home 
You're gonna walk alone 
You're gonna walk so far 
You're gonna wonder who you are 

Shame 

Love is good and love is kind 
Love is good and love is blind 
Love is good and love is mine 
Love is good all the time 

Hello goodbye, you know you made us cry...
Rise! Love is here
Oh don't make me wonder
Life's never clear where choice is a gift
To use and abuse
To build on proof
Oh don't make me suffer
Birds find the wind and wing
Rest in the shells I've designed
Run through the fields I've denied
And stroll upon the years I'm alive
There's a sun that shines in
There's a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse to please
Breathe! Love is air
Oh don't make me suffer
To dash debonair where chaste is the wish
To bust with pain
A heart goes blank
Oh don't make me wonder
To ask on behalf of you
Of you, where are you?
Where are you in you?

There's a sun that shines in
There's a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse to please
There's a sun that shines in
There's a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse
And all I'd ever use in me
There's a sun that shines in me
There's a sun that shines
There's a sun that shines in me
Anaise! Anaise! You're the captive's code
In a word, a word I can't let go
I need myself, you haunt me Anaise
In a fonce, a sign of lonely ones
When you're here, to nash, what's done is done
It's simply cold, the spiders all crawl on me

Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers let me hear from you
As you, oh, go on down, honey
Love you, Anaise
Anaise! Anaise! What's spread is blown
Are your times black hearts and laced?
And I miss? Now don't ya? Anais

Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers letters hear from you
As you go asunder
Oh, send this bag away

If I could?
Suppose I'd tell
It's all lost
To race against her will
Imagine way the and twilight by yourself

Oh, just stand within the breaks
Oh, what becomes of us as lovers?
Oh, send this bag away
Lovers let us hear from you
As you all go under, Anaise
Love you Anaise
Don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer
I'll never see what you see
It's not me
So beautiful and free
I'll never be what you need
I can't help it at all
I was born so beautiful
But now I'm ugly

And I rot in my skin
As a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing
I know there's nothing I can say
To change
The judgment in their ways
I'll never be what you need
I can't help it at all
My love was so beautiful
But now I'm ugly
Yeah

I'm good enough, but I don't care
I'm good enough, but I'm not there
I'm good enough, but I don't care
The sun is out, but I'm not there

(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough, but I don't care (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) The sun is out, but I'm not there (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough (somewhere)
(I can go anywhere) I'm good enough (somewhere)

I don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer
I'll never see what you see
And I rot in my skin
As a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing
Because I'm ugly
Away, away foul dream
You're gonna listen now to me
No rules or in betweens
You're gonna listen now to me
Waste all your time
Find another kind of boy, whoa
A face upon the line
Offensive I don't care to hold

Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along, you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, you're mine
Mine

Inside
The drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

In my affection, too
You're gonna listen now to me
But stop what's left as rule
You're gonna listen now to me

Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along, you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, you're mine
Mine

Inside
The drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
To remedy this waiting
'Cause I will bang to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

Don't you ever be afraid
No more, no more, no more

'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
Don't you ever be afraid
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum
Yeah
I see you comin' from the sky
I see you callin' from the sky
Your sky can't heal you again
Your sky won't heal you again
Why must I try oh why must I try
'Cause I'm waiting for you
Like never waited for me
Why oh why, oh why why oh why
I try why oh why
Must I try
I know what you mean
Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Where the cool winds blow I must surely go
For my love calls me lo to drag her from the depths of my soul
When will I see her again?
The other side of friends
The darkened clouds of death
The empty-breathed desire
Dirty you face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when you love goes unrequited
Restless in my speech
And ruthless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt of her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen again
No other lovers to bend
Just rotten apples to eat
Slathered yellow distant scorn
Dirty you face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when you love goes unrequited
Life just fades away
Purity just begs
Dust to dust we're wired into sadness
Taking over  we're taking over 
Throw the weight up off your shoulders now 
That we can show our love 

It's almost over  it's almost over 
No more war and no more soldiers 
To stand against his love 

Away with all the troubles that you've made 
Away with waiting for another day 
Away 

Look ma  the sun is shining on me 
Impatient in love and aching to be 
Could you believe in heaven 
If heaven was all you had? 

We're taking over, we're taking over 
Throw away your four-leafed clovers 
And stand beside this love 

Away with everything you've grown to hate 
Away with everything that holds you safe 
Away 

And every light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
Every light light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
Every light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
I'm never alone 

Look ma, the sun is shining on me 
Taking my time to do as I please
Could you believe in heaven 
If heaven was all you had? 

The sun is beaming, radiating 
All the love we are creating 
We are creating 

And every light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
Every light light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
Every light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
Every light I've found 
Is every light that's shining down on me 
I'm never alone
Say hello before you say goodbye
I should go before you make me cry
She wants to bleed every drop inside of me
But I am to please the little girl inside of me, too 

Yeah, yeah
You know I hate to say it
Oh no, I always stay
I don't want to be like the others, please

Who is sorry now?
Who is sorry now?
If I show you how,
Will you let me down?

Slit my wrists and die a whore
Love to love to love what you adore
I can give you anything,
But please let me be your everything
You lose

Yeah, yeah
You know I hate to say it
Oh no, I always stay
I don't want to be like the others, please

Who is sorry now?
If I show you how,
Will you let me down?
Will you let me down?
Who is sorry now?
Who is sorry now?

My love is weakness
My love is oh so wrong
My love is sadness
My love is oh so strong
My teeth are razor sharp
My love is fucking strong
I'll be with you
But not for long

Oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah
You know I hate to say it
Oh no, I always stay
I don't want to be like the others, please

Who is sorry now?
Who is sorry now?
Who is sorry now?
If I show you how,
Will you let me down?
Will you let me down?
Please let me down
Please let me down

(song's over)
Not worth asking, who I'm supposed to be
Not worth saying, seems I'm free
Not worth reaching, to anyone at all
Not worth reaching out to stop this fall
I'm on my own
Yeah, I'm on my own
Not worth being, I might already be
I just want someone to reach for me
Not worth sinkin', its not worth diggin down
I've been here before, and hate what I've found
Its too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away
Its too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away, so far away
Not worth asking, who I'm supposed to be
Not worth saying something, seems I'm free
Not worth reaching to anyone at all
Not worth reaching out, Ill stop this fall
But I like you just the same
You've got to know some how
That I'm the one to blame
We've come so far along
To end this destiny
You've got to know somehow
That its too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away
Yeah, its too late, too late
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I've gotta go so far away, so far away
You and me 
Meant to be 
Immutable
Impossible 
It's destiny 
Pure lunacy
Incalculable
Inseparable 

And for the last time 
You're everything that I want and asked for 
You're all that I dream 
Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 
Protected and the lover of 

A pure soul 
And beautiful 
You 
Don't understand 
Don't fear me now 
I will breath 
For the both of us 
Travel the world
Traverse the skies 
Your home is here 
Within my heart 

And for the first time 
I feel as though I am reborn in my mind 
Recast as child and mystic sage 

Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 

For the first time 
I'm telling how much I need and bleed for 
Your every move and waking sound in my time 
I'll wrap my wire around your heart 
And your mind 
You're mine forever now 
Who wouldn't be the one you love and live for 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love and die for 
Who wouldn't be the one you love
I wish I was blank
I wish I was blank
I wish I could thank
I wish I was blank
I'd write a letter to you
And there'd be nothing to it
I wouldn't hem and haw
On just how to start it
I wish I was blank
I wish I was blank
I wish I could thank
I wish I was blank
I wish I'd stand up straight
I wish I'd said things different
I wish I'd said nothing
Things would be so perfect
I wish myself to keep
I pray my soul to sleep
I wish myself away
I wish I was blank
Hush my love don't fight
Never leave here this night
Once bright don't fade
What is love, love, old ache
Let freedoms in flight
May stray from our right
Never leave here softly

I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that
Can't see what it means
Yet still I love you
Like everything
Goes and goes
It goes

If you break believe me
If you take deceive me
To the sound of one clapping hand
Is your heart so lonely
If your own only
As good as can be had on that

Hush my love don't fight
Never leave here this night

I've seen the world
On a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that
Can't see what it means
Yet still I love you
Like everything
Goes and goes

It goes and goes
It goes
I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
I've seen the world
Upon a thousand dreams
It goes and goes
Goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
Softly stolen under our blanket skies 
And rescue me from me and all that I believe 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 

Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree 
Hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabies 
And tell me I am still 
The man I'm supposed to be 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 
Will you leave me too? 

Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound 
And I am changing, changing 
And if we died right now, this fool you love somehow 
Is here with you 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
Softly stolen under our blanket skies 
And rescue me from me and all that I believe 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 

Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree 
Hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabies 
And tell me I am still 
The man I'm supposed to be 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Will you leave me too? 
Will you leave me too? 

Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound 
And I am changing, changing 
And if we died right now, this fool you love somehow 
Is here with you 
I won't deny the pain 
I won't deny the change 
And should I fall from grace here with you 
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?
Blank page is all the rage 
Never meant to say anything 
In bed I was half dead 
Tired of dreaming of rest 
Got dressed drove the state line 
Looking for you at the five and dime 
Stop sign told me stay at home 
Told me you were not alone
Blank page was all the rage 
Never meant to hurt anyone 
In bed I was half dead 
Tired of dreaming of rest 
You haven't changed 
You're still the same 
May you rise as you fall 
You were easy you are forgotten 
You are the ways of my mistakes 
I catch the rainfall
Through the leaking roof 
That you had left behind 
You remind me 
Of that leak in my soul 
The rain falls 
My friends call 
Leaking rain on the phone 

Take a day plant some trees 
May they shade you from me 
May your children play beneath
Blank page was all the rage 
Never meant to say anything 
In bed I was half dead 
Tired of dreaming of rest 
Got dressed drove the state line 
Looking for you at the five and dime 
But there I was picking pieces up 
You are a ghost 
Of my indecision 
No more little girl
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings
Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known
Speak to me in a language I can hear humour me before I have to go 
Deep in thought I forgive everyone 
As the cluttered streets greet me once again 
I know I can't be late  supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away 
So I pull my collar up and face the cold  on my own 
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet 
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk 

Steeple guide me to my heart and home 
The sun is out and up and down again 
I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth 

And you can make it last, forever you 
You can make it last, forever you 
And for a moment I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world 

I've journeyed here and there and back again 
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return 

I'll make the effort, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse 
And you can make it last, forever you 

You can make it last, forever you
I don't want to fight
Every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back
To places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left as scraps
Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy

You're as real as real ever was
Just because you feel you've had enough
You believe that someone gave us up

I wanna be there when you're happy
I wanna love you when you're sad
Can't stand the morning rain
Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun
Close your eyes, you'll see
The angel dies

I don't wanna be anything believes
A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along, you'll see the world
The the crowd unfolds
The college starts to flow, and then you're home

Oh, is the White House all they want?
I'll sing for

You're as real as real ever was
Just because you're every living soul
You're so real that someone gave us up

Don't break the oath
I wanna love you when you're happy
Don't break the soul
I wanna be there when you're sad
Retain the pouring rain

The unreal, as real as any loss
Too easy now
The unreal in every living soul
Dumb day now

Can't stand the blazing sun
Can't stand the morning rain
Ah, get out, I'll take your place again
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone, no

If it's the White House all they want
Black house they'll get
Ride on, motherfucker
Sister above
Lead on my lover
Daddy's not comin' home

So long my mother
So long ago
She loves me like a lover
Every house is now your home

Even though you lied to me
We love you

Right on, motherfucker
Sister above
Yeah, my lover
Every house is now your home
She's got her decks and her vodkas
And every man is a faggot
She said

She's got a new ? wells book
She wrote his name on the ?
Instead
Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday
What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
Walking through your life

I'm pretty caned in Ibiza
None of her friends would believe her
She said

She can't wait for the Notting Hill
And he's already had a belly full
Instead
Monday, Tuesday, it's the same
Wednesday, Thursday, act your age
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
Walking through your life

Oh, oh, oh oh!
You're nearly forty now, have you forgotten how?
You go with whatever's easy, there's nothing left to believe in
It's just a word that you heard on the radio
You're not a mod or a rocker
You've never heard of Nirvana

You're nearly forty now, have you forgotten how?
Like when we used to walk the beach
Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday
Monday, Tuesday, it's the same
Wednesday, Thursday, act your age
As Friday, pretty close to Monday
Monday, Tuesday, act your age
Wednesday, Thursday, it's the same
As Friday, pretty close to Monday

What were you thinking
What were you doing, yeah?
Lyrics
Cupid hath pulled back hi sweetheart's bow
To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

See the devil may do as the devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek
Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one cupids arrow under your coat

And in the land of star crossed lovers
And barren hearted wanderers
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull
We seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable
Our hopes dead gathering dust to dust
In faith, in compassion, and in love
To my mistakes  to my mistakes of cowardice 
She shimmy shakes  the Jimmy Jakes of consequence 
Born of the airs and dues  my airs of madness do declare 
That it's o.k.  it's love 
It's what you wanted to see  it's who you wanted to be 
For what you needed to need  she'll make it up 
Love  it's who you know 
Machine gun blues  her vacant rush is so steel 
I'm unaware  lost inside your visions 
I got mine too over, I got mine and I got you 
'Cause I know you, you're love 
It's what you wanted to see, it's who you wanted to be 
For what you needed to need, she'll make it up 
Love, it's who you know 
When I lost my mind, I knew I was in for a long time
Can I look up to you as you look down on me 
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me 
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be 
For what I needed to need, she'll make it 
Love, it's who you know
Give me tears  give me love 
Let me rest  Lord above 
Send the bored  your restless 
The feedback scarred devotionless 

You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 

Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove 
Will our words ever be enough? 
Just in time to lose 

Give me sight and barren breast 
Pure snow and happiness 
Give me time, give me peace 
And I will prove my release 

You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
Trapped in the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 

Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove 
Will our time ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 

You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 
You're all a part of me now 

You're all a part of me now 
And if I fall 
You're all a part of me now 
In the sun 
You're all a part of me now 

Will our love ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Will our love ever be enough? 
Just in time to prove
I don't love you for what it's worth
So if you're leaving can you hurt
Cherry blossom, this is goodbye
Come here lately and you fly

When they say what it's worth
The world tells you first
Then you know where to hurt
The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard
Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
Lover let me please, be the one
Know the prayers to make
Flowers made to fade
And when this world to wait
It'll wait for us

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard

Yes I loved you as a matter of fact
You first are wrapped up, and that's that

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
You once made me smile
When you strayed

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard
The world's on fire
The world's on fire, have you heard
Lover have you breathed
To make for your relief (To make for your belief)
So I'm no longer here by your side
What's to hide

The world's on fire
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Monday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Tuesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Wednesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Thursday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Friday)

Lover, lover let's pretend
We're born as innocents
Cast into the world
With apple eyes 

To wish wish dangerous
My dear delirious
To try and leave
The rest of us behind

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

Kiss kiss all of this
The hiss that we had miss
And understand what can't be understood

Sear those thoughts of me
Alone and unhappy
I never liked me anyway

If by chance
Or circumstance
We should fail
Don't be so sad

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

In a dream
We are connected
Siamese twins
At the wrist

And then I knew we'd been forsaken
Expelled from paradise
I can't believe them
When they say that it's alright
Words can't define what I feel inside
Who needs them?
Caught with this virus of my mind
I give in to my disease, of my needs
To my disease, of my needs

She really loves to break
Her dad says it's OK
She really loves to break
And give it all away

Her ma says she's afraid
What more can she fake
She really needs to break
And give herself away

She gave it all away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
We really love the USA
