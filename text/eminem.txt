Lyrics
Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica.
Wait a minute. You hold it right there. Me and that woman love each other.
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together. I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger. That's not what I want to do
I love her! And we're gonna be together, never
Yeah, yeah,
Follow me, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world so dark
And oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold oh!

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go God only knows
Stay wide awake

Fe fi fo fum
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park it and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore your the kinda girl that I'd
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wida
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I mite flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian girl now lets see ya have triplets and I'll
Disintegrate them babies as soon as that out her with formalda-
Hide and cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vrim! vrim! and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out, uh!

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, god only knows
Stay wide awake

So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me
He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny
She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty
Stay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, God only knows
Stay wide awake
Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage your power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars
Jabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water
Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that
What was that dial nine-one-one someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, God only knows
Stay wide awake

(Fades out)
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G 
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus]
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!

Hey, fuck that!
Outsiders
Pace one
Young Zee
Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
(You copy?)

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ah-yo  this song is for anyone 
F*** it just shut up and listen 

Ah-yo 
I sit back with this pack of zigzags 
And this bag of this weed 
It gives me the s*** needed to be 
The most meanest M-C on this on this earth 
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre s*** that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self 
To relieve all this tension dispensing me 
Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently 
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 
When you freaks see me out in the streets 
When I'm eating or feedin' my daughter 
To not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherf*** anything 
I'm not Mr. NSYNC and I'm not what your friends think 
I'm not Mr. Friendly 
I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be 
It's just me 

[Chorus]
And I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant 
And "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 
And all of this controversy circles me 
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em 
But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb 
It's the one you put up when you don't give a f*** 
When you won't just put up with the bulls*** they pull 
'Cause they full of s*** too 
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school 
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at middle America 
Now it's a tragedy 
Now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

[Chorus]

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is" 
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
And I just do not have the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same f***ing questions 
What school did I go to? 
What hood I grew up in? 
The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it 
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get 
But I can't take a s*** in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph 
You can call me an a**hole 
I'm glad cause 

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, It's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'm a be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary paid hourly until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows, me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'm a face my demons
I'm manning up, I'm a hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it! 'Cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
So this is it
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
[Chorus]
Hi! My name is (what?) 
My name is (who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?) 
My name is (what?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (what?) 
My name is (who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?) 
My name is (what?)
My name is Slim Shady

Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?

Hi kids! Do you like violence? (yeah yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids? (uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (yeah yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (huh)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (oh)
And Dr.Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head"
Uh-uh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus]

My English teacher wanted to have flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screamin' at me
"Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (oh thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (ah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it,
"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Chorus]

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk 
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (c'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? (wah)
You ain't got no tits (wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (bang)
I'm steamin' mad (argh)
And by the way when you see my dad? (yeah)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

[Chorus]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge thinkin' of Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should of been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you fagots in public
I'm a love it (ha ha ha)

Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (he he)
A bunch of little kids want to swear just like me
And run around screamin', "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer
Fagot you to Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' fagots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(Ah!) Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' Mile Road, south of ten
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots!

'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you want to run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three sixty
Now these kids dis me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with M-C Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you fagot!
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on T-V
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, double X-L, double X-L
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ah fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me (take shots at me)

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me (take shots at me)
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on "Set it Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "truce truce!"
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by"

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know
Pick up the god damn phone
Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do screw Dre?
You went there looking for me
Boo that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg

You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Dre
Que Lupe? You want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Ok yeeah, I'm coo-coo, hey?" Well, screw you

And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Oh touche
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one True Blue Ace
But you ain't and I can see you when you make
That little boo-boo face 'cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
'Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink I'm back on my fuck ho's
But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?
I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on

'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
'Cause you ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian
Ah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

'Cause you told me
You'd love me,
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking, life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea

And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale
Of 1 to 10, shit I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bicth

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void bitch I'm a droid,
I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink
You fucking pigs all you good boys doink doink doing

I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out I hope you hear this song
And grow into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead
And I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)(I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head (you baby)
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you
Justin? It's Zoe.
Kelly did not have me call, however
I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life.

And I seriously wanna call his f***ing agent
And tell him how f***ing disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset and
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch. Goodbye.
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Shady!
Aftermath
Ha ha, g-g-g-g, G-Unit!
Ha ha! (Ha ha)

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your a** up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your a** up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and b****in'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the f*** is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the c*** of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherf***er hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Yeah! Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that "Detox" album, it's comin'
We goin' make Dre do it (ha ha)

Let's go!  Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin' out
Peace!

Oh s***, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me!

Bye bye!
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams

Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees

Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?

The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so

In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!

Ew ew ew ew
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes,but I'm only human
but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet
Shady, aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)

Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

I think I'm losing control

God, come one,

You're coming home with me
And my boy,

Good bye

Your walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin'
And your in a nightmare
It's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waitin' for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's on a ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin' in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a klonopin
While I'm noddin'
In and out on the ottoman
At the ramada inn
Holdin' onto the pill bottle then
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonald's
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
Shit
Guess I must of just blacked out again
Not again

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em
I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin'
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin'
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin'
Grab my flannel and my bandana' then
Kiss the naked manequin' man again
You can see him standin' in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin' hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and not so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
When I slaughter dem

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em
I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint fifth of jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered the family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cousin
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink his bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdlin' screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's three am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up(up)

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
Yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
Yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
Yo (yo)
A yo ( a yo)
And everyone should get along.. 
Okay children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!) 
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ah!) 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull  
His back starts to, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" 
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
  
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!) 

(Mushrooms killed Kenny!  
(So, fucked up, right now)

Chicken call (Cluck, cluck), snatchin' up men's

Tell what what you want, baby daddy got that
Gotta get it this week while there's no sales tax
You can't detect sarcasm, me I detect a freak who like orgasms 
Tre I hold you down matter fact I'll be a blast to pin yo ass down (Damn, damn)

Tell your friends I'm still in your ear
She actin' like your pet, what you trained her this year
Tramp wit a pissy attitude, say I grind food, and I bet she be cool
All she want is attention, lemme give her some

Take this big face, get a cab, take yo ass home (Least he gave you a hundred)
I wasn't that rude, this ain't Outkast, me and you
Yo mama, and yo cousin too, I'm tryin' to keep it simple
I'm tryin' to fuck you, see'mon

[Chorus]

[Royce]
Okay, you want money, I want sex
We can both, take it or leave it, it makes us even
We like those freak hoes that like our style
Clean up that pole, go upside down

Us cuttin' the chains, it's just easy
I call you mama, you breast feed me
Wait, your tummy hurts (Oh), you feelin' better
You can blow, like the Neptunes, after the Jigga record

Me and my nigga Tre can tag team you
Grab our two-ways and both beam you
We can take you out, but your friends talkin' for ya
Oh, I'm sorry, you hungry, we got some sausage for ya

All it needs is a bun, and you can see it get pumped
Extra special sauce, now eat it for lunch
Size ten is the dick and the heat is the pump
Oh I see what you want, she so indecisive, cause
 
[Chorus: x2]
Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen

Ey yo
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
You've been driving me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
Yeah what-up Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh-no he didn't!
Ah! They didn't do it again,
What-what, what-what?
Did you shit on these niggas two times Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sure!
Uh-uh, naw, ya smell that?
This is special right here
What-what, what-what-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
Uh, to the boogie-oogie-oogie,
Yeah, you know! What's crackin' Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit)
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(Watch out now!) Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw, is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
(Hehe) You and what army could harm me?
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
(East-side!) Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz', and I carry it all day
(Blaow!) Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein' Andre,
But I

Somehow, someway tell 'em, nigga
You know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang!
Damn baby girl what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club, with my nephew Eminem
(Whats up Slim?) Whattup cu'? (What up Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope, done hooked up
With the King of the motherfuckin' West coast, bay-bay!

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust?  They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

Aw naw, big slim dog
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy bay-bay
He's Shday!
He's so crazy!
Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin' a living
Off of the world's misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at moms, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on T-V
Or heard the C-D usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot
You happy now?
Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do' (the back do')
Come back and shoot the club up with a four-four (a four-four)

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah!
Ooh shit (ooh  hey  ooh)
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in in a minute
Ah-yo  this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin'
You're beginning to think women are swimmin' in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outter space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't want to but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me (Whoa)

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me?

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as you
Schemein' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy has got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs
Are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal chord,
So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls
Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now I'm gonna try to find some more

Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't want to but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me (Whoa)

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me?

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life live it however you want to
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every morning
But your young you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I would've did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done before I know it
I'll be forty with a forty on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grand kids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin' shmashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't want to but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me (Whoa)

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me?

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't want to but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me (Whoa)

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me?

Drugs really got a hold on me
Really got a hold on me
'Cause drugs really got a hold on me
They really got a hold on me
It's like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Hate to be the bad guy

I've been driving around your side of the town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck

It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, god police, ah!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, Im stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah 'cause Im talking a lot of shit but Im backing it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water but Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers personas have a facade and
Matthew and Stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until its gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so!
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
But its time to walk away
Im ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop

So one last time, Im back
Before it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not 
Always make sense to you right now
But hey, 
What daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]

And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
Nah man
Not quite finished yet

Girl I think,
You just might'a tried to pull a muh'fucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker
In your walk-way? Better co-operate
Or get saute'd and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
M-C's get so quiet you can hear a muh'fucking dog whistle while I walk by
'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits while you're cringin'
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
While I spin spin even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe
While he's trying to roll a snowball but,
Don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go y'all

Now here we go go go!

Get up! Baby get a move on, 
Like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You will never think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I reek it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every muh'fucking chicken fore' it hatches
Cause, you can bet your ass that we gone get it crackin'
Like a Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gone have Kurt Kobain askin'
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
I'm fashionable and 'bout as rational
As a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it till it pops up
Y'all are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up
Me I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out, "Ohp, What?"
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot butt Sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because

Here we go go go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'm a show you why I Kang Xi
Stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore know you want more,
Bitches tell I put the Mat back into Mathers
Cause I'm a fucking problem, Run boy!
Every flow got it mastered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, Yeah
In other words I'm a Bass turd!
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gassing the tank near steal plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism, cant resist him now, can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand your flow.
Understand my flow?
Bitch I flow like Troy Palumalu's hair, boy.
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch since you're queer boy.
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys
Here we go go go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time

Ha ha

Peace!
(Like a verbal seduction, when
Seduction when I tell 'em)
(Girls on the floor)
I dunno man, just feels like, well a lot different
(Girls on the floor)
(Like a verbal seduction)
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
(Girls on the floor)
Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like

I feel like I'm morphin', into something that's so incredible, that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, and endorphins I effect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
Your strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you're Bishop the don Juan
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like "she's fucking with dude, she wants son"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(Like a verbal seduction, when)
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)

She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, aw
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sick back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up, cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is sounding off, and Obama took the bomb from my name, aw
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(Like a verbal seduction, when)
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)

It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducing her, loosing up with a little freestyle
Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her
Let her wait don am I losing ya don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blowout
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it punk, but none of it's fucking with me
Prick you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables? quit playing
These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From sucking my dick, aw fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(Like a verbal seduction, when)
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Like a verbal seduction, when)
Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is... what you thought it wasn't
It beez... the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jan Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer

You wacker than the motherf***er you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, f*** it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then

My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your a**

B****, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the f*** out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherf***in throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus]
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin _F*** the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols

But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin s*** out of proportion

The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a f***in trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

[Chorus]

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion

F*** droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherf***in style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of b****es
Sick of naggin bosses b****in while I'm washin dishes

In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team

Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]

Hey, f*** that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..
Yeah, Shady (Woo!)
Ha ha, 50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT
(Here we go again, yeah)
Uh huh, ha ha ha
Does it make you mad, when I switch my flow
You can't understand, how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire, 'cause Shady said so
(Here we go!) I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush, to try and get the throne
I just get on the track, and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt
You may see something else, I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song, recycled
We all much rather get along, than fight you
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin' you faster
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka' that wants ta
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk
When I walked up to you, like "Ja, what up dog?"
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then
When you were standing there with all ya men
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on

[Chorus: x2]
I, know, you don't want it wit me
You, know, you don't want it wit me
You, talk, but soon we goin' see
You, don't wanna bump heads with me

(Tony Yayo!) You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuard Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buying a new pistol
I clap at yo ass, wit this chrome .38
And put six through ya hats, that's seven and 3-8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe, you bleed on the turnpike
You know and I know, who took ya chain
You got robbed two times, so ya ass a lame
I there to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies, with Steven Segal

[Chorus: x2]

(Lloyd Banks!) Fuck that I'm tired of hearing
These industry niggas starting to get outta hand
Like I won't find ya whereabouts, by stomp-ing 'em out ya man
You killing New York, even in Comp-ton, they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out the van, and
They see me pop up on icy, cause I could
You den lost yo money, prolly forgot yo way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid, it's hard to make good songs
How you want it wit' us, when half your artists got makeup on
Every magazine I open, you on ya knees, taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothing about what pain is sucka
I put yo ass to the ground, like a train conductor, motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, nigga!
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit!
What the fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?
'Cause we move units, uh huh
And don't think we ain't billing you
For this motherfucking studio time
Matter fact keep it over fifty, we call it even, ha
I don't understand
Why are you bein' so mean!?
You're a mean, mean man!

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening
OK now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this,
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up,
Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
That I could bust one take
Without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth OK
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open,
You're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch,
A bunch of sweets or somethin'
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin' through the gum
Your breath stinks,
Want to chew some gum?
(Yes I do sir what am I on?)
You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out
Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful
Mean things, is my own insecurities!

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror
Notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like stickin' a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin' this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Fuck off my dick
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aw shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin' I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurin' befo', after and durin the show
has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushin' you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin' a hoe
It's pandemo-nium standin' know when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're givin' me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spittin' the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap
and Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the linin'
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in
It's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!
FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screamin' fuck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin' my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin'
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice swear {?}
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waitin to be hooked to IV as {?} as well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin' hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here lettin' the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin'
We do it to try to do without tryin'
(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?
And everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!) 
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ah!) 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull  
His back starts to, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" 
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus]

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!) 

(Mushrooms killed Kenny!  
(So, fucked up, right now)
Mm
You high baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Ha ha ha
Talk to me
You want me to tell you somethin'
Uh huh
I know what you wanna hear

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world

Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now

I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

Don't get me wrong
I love these hoes
It's no secret
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby

I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world

Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not phased,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name,
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

Your superman, your superman

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman
This is another public service announcement
Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a fuck)
Slim shady does not give a fuck, what you think?
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
(Yeah)
Anything else?
Yeah, sue me
Life
By Marshal Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down

And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand,
I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on,
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough,
Because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home
To have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a B-M
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blond whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-be	 saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'?
Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!
To the rap mobile, let's go!

Marshall! Marshall!

Bitches and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry, step right up!
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is

Marshall!

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends
Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
Oh! Ha!
I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes
Lately, I really
Feel like I'm, rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely, apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complaining, but life keeps on complicating
And, I'm debating on, leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see that I'm grieving
I try and hide it but I can't
Why do I act like I am all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realizin' I need, help
Can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been having ups and down
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly dallying, around with the idea
Of ending this shit right here
I'm hating my reflection
I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care
I don't give a fuck, only thing that I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid that if I close my eyes then I might see her, shit

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom
Napping at noon, yeah dad's in a bad mood
He's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you
Can't stop with these pills, and you've falling off with your skills
And your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart, ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he'd fight first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vikes, Percs, and Methadone Pills
Yeah Em tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like Yes-Men
And they gon' do whatever I says, whenever I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

(Don't know what I'm going through,
But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame, and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
Whacha want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse, and the truth is
Fame is starting to give me an excuse
To be at a, all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn D-V-D of the
First tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts, so I fast forward
Sleeping pills would make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on dole 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me
Daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

(Don't know what I'm going through,
But I just keep going through changes)

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
Plus somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back, I'm ma be bullet proof
I'm a do it just for proof
I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
See it just hit me, that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things that I would have never got say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailey this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'll do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things, to explain
When it rains, guess it pours, guess it does
Wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost as if to say
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say
I guess I'm

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep going through changes
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire
Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

(Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmo who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dumb da dumb da da 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Aw man
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could of made you anticipate auch an ass-whipping, okay
'Til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel
Invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn
Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made"
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, 
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to get the party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi dark
And when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and probably barf
And my prediction is you're probably fall
Either in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything spinning 
You're beginnin' to think like a woman
Are swimming in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a forty-two-car pileup
Earth calling pilot to copilot
Looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might dieif go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in outer spaceship just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't want to, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them
Oh! It's music to my ears, Oh man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin great man! Okay, let me see
How could I begin
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really ask for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk
Weisman Gale, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin, I want to bag ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin pump
Zappin Eric Clapton, (Shaft?), Frank Zappa crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want
I mean I really want you bad you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupunc-ture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-

You can be a permanent fixture
In my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whit trixter
My sig-nature sound, when the tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put on in an instant, wow
Man what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma
Ceuticals, it's beautiful, pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I'll cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy, I'm like a fucken Red Sonia
Get it stuck in your cornea
Nice knowin ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin
Drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck ya doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucken on
What the fuck are you doin'
You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower, blow on your
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad-

In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molesting you
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle
Flesh, tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment, just make an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle, new thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit
Lured the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie even took me a polaroid, bitch
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sake he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a glad
Yeah! Oh! Get Up! I said get up! Let's go!
Better watch out (now)
Cause here we come (come)
And we ain't stoppin' until
We see the mornin' sun (sun)
So give us room to do our thing
Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
So err'body come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone (one)

Now first of all I'm a boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance!

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa!"
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
Cause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west, but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cause homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
C'mon

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
Cause girl I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground
And flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
You feel me, y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up!

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh! 
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch 
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)

Slim Shady

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, 
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship 
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

Hi! My name is (huh?) 
My name is (who?)
My name is 
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (what?) 
My name is (who?)

Hi! My name is (huh?)

Hi! My name is (what?) 
My name is (who?)
My name is 
Slim Shady

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'? 
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, 
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk 
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits! 
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi! My name is (what?) 
My name is (who?)
My name is 
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?) 
My name is (what?)
My name is

Hi! My name is (who?)

Slim Shady
Yeah boy,
Better ring the alarm boy,
Dem know what's coming boy,
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fucking Bomboclat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I'm the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
And Bon Voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-dee in this bitch, 
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,
Fucking fictional characters and fairytales,
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
But it ain't fiction its fact boy beware its real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero's shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
Like your fa-da fucking ya mada

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on them,
I don't want no dog gone beef,
See ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me,
Drop the bomb on 'em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef,
See ain't no reason to set the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the real McCoy,
You little boys can't even fill voids,
Party's over kids, kill the noise,
Here come the killjoys,
Me and Dre steel alloys,
The rap crown royals,
That scalp cowboys
Now how that sound for ya
Yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
So kick your shoes off,
Before you have a sound voyage,
And siyanara see ya fuckers tomorrow,
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar,
Whip ass on ya, that's the last straw your hoping to draw,
Yeah you fresher than most boy, I'm just doper than all boy,
I'm that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
There ain't no boy who can do what I do boy I'm a star,
Boy, I told you boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm DeShaun,
Holten in this Bitch, I'm the proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, fuck around and blow ya to Sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy your da plot,
Your gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not,
Apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
We get to beefing, ain't no telling at what point it will stop,
All I got to do is point to the spot,
When the bomb drops boy does it drop,
And when it does boy there's a problem

[Chorus]

Boy don't jinx yourself,
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I'm sick as hell boy,
You better run and tell someone else,
Bringin' hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy who done said it,
Who said he was better,
I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
Back better than ever,
The cheddar shredder the grater, the beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later,
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You 'bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
I'm bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,
Couldn't agree with you more if you were to say my fucking shit doesn't stink,
Shady fucking aftermath boy the ship doesn't sink it just floats in the fucking water
'Til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby
Back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind
We represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, 'cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing, a zany acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.
I'm infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.
I'm infinite
And everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!) 
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ah!) 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull  
His back starts to, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" 
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus]

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!) 

(Mushrooms killed Kenny!  
(So, fucked up, right now)
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you where? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus]

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans",
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, 
Shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

[Chorus]

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog,
Come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!
Obie Trice
Real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shot when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating "Hey"
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
"Testing attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Kids!
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
People! It feels so good to be back.
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new and improved, you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge,
The wrong button to push,
No friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese.
I'm a pit bull off his leash,
All this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo,
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple,
Can-a-bitch don't want no beef with Slim? No!
Not even on my radar, so won't you please jump off my dick,
Lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance,
Aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back.
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration,
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like,
This white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt,
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave,
Won't go nowhere, do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there, go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your muthafuckin' ass gets drafted,
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
Till you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin,
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping,
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtracks crashin'
All this terror America demands action,
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy.
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans.
I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy? When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait,
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me,
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully,
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic product I got it the antibiotic,
Ain't nobody hotter and so on
And yada yada, god I talk a lotta hem de lay la la la,
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make,
Keep makin' new shit,
Produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege, somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a fuckin' younger me, fuck the fee,
I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny,
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the K-Y,
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
Cana-bitch, won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants to square dance with you
Yee-Haw!
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life

Too late
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinkedsold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole!
Thanks for the support, asshole!

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but Goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my beltword to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo! My soul's escapin'
Through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door, retreatin'
Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch!
How do fuckin' magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time, it ain't never gonna stop
A pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
So now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
Im going back to what got me here, yeah, cocky
And cant knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
"I remember it clearly, even today"
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent
Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey
"Eminem!"

"No!"

"Eminem!"

"No!"

(Laughs "wake the fuck up, motherfucker!"

"What do you want from me??"

"Remember me?"

"I killed you!"

"Thought I was dead, didn't you?"

"What do you want from me?!"

"I'm alive!"

"Oh, god!"

"Get up!"

"No"

"Get up and look in the mirror!"

"I don't want to!"

"Look in the mirror to see your reflection"

"Leave me alone!"

"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me!
Look in the motherfucking mirror!!!"

"Leave me the fuck alone!!"
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ah-yo  this song is for anyone 
Fuck it just shut up and listen 

Ah-yo 
I sit back with this pack of zigzags 
And this bag of this weed 
It gives me the shit needed to be 
The most meanest M-C on this on this earth 
'Cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self 
To relieve all this tension dispensing me 
Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently 
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 
When you freaks see me out in the streets 
When I'm eating or feedin' my daughter 
To not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuck anything 
I'm not Mr. NSYNC and I'm not what your friends think 
I'm not Mr. Friendly 
I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be 
It's just me 

[Chorus]
And I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant 
And "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 
And all of this controversy circles me 
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em 
But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb 
It's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'Cause they full of shit too 
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school 
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at middle America 
Now it's a tragedy 
Now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

[Chorus]

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is" 
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
And I just do not have the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to? 
What hood I grew up in? 
The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it 
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get 
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph 
You can call me an asshole 
I'm glad cause 

[Chorus]
"What! What! What!"
Yeah nigga! It's D12 up in this motherfucker!
You know how we get nigga we wild in the club
Motherfuckers, everybody get crunk in Detroit too nigga!
So wile the fuck out!

[Chorus]
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It) 
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Pour your forty out. (Guzzle It)
Bitch!

We fucked up,
Let us in the club.
One of why'all niggas gon' catch a slug, (Yeah)
I'm so drunk I could hurl for a month.
Any nigga pop shit, go to the trunk.
D12 start shit, nigga come get us,
Seven mile Runyan, wild niggas wit us,
Cause all my niggas is talkin' that shit.
Ain't got no problem, with smackin no bitch.
I'll have my wife, cut your throat.
Blunts, gans, that's all we smoke
Wild the fuck out, stab you with a knife,
It's D12 nigga, we ready to fuckin' fight.

[Chorus]

Who tryin' to be the first one to catch this plate in the throat!
You know the po-po don't let me hold them toasters no mo'
I just cut three people, you gon' be number four
If you don't back the fuck up, and get the fuck up off the flo'.
My crew is takin' over as soon as we hit the do'
You hit the door then we comin' in and you goin' home.
Security that can't even stop us because they know,
Runyan Avenue soldiers hold it down wherever we go.
Suckin' on our forty's and holdin' up .44's.
We come with toasters like we just opened saving's and loans.
And we don't need your brew tonight homie we brought our own.
So grab whatever you sippin' on and let's get it on!!!!

[Chorus]

We deep as a motherfuck, we 'bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We don't supposed to be in here with our weapons but still they let us.
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle.
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble.
Elbows flying, niggas crying, niggas bleeding, you retreating.
Run into your car and skatin off, We G'ing
We make example out of you haters runnin' your mouth.
You the reason why your peoples is pourin they 40z out.
Dirty Dozen whiling, beat niggas bloodied.
And you gon' have to pour out a keg for all your homies.

[Chorus]

I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.
Eighty proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me then
Only talk to a bitch with burgundy hair.
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
See that top on that forty, you know it's comin' loose.
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.
Packin' mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet.
Smoking weed, drinking henny, remy, in that jimmy
Don't worry if we run out the corner store got plenty.

[Chorus]
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 ,4, 3, 2, 1
Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11,12,13, pistols big as M 16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, 2 nina's, a peace and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one they gon' think its machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banna clips loaded
Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady popping them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixing coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you don't get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mac or no mac it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packin' so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass you don't wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, mili mac a mac milli
Really homie don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wonderin what the dealy
Fuck it lets just get busy D Twizzys back up in the hizzy!

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping
Its D12 is back up in this bitch, uh, there ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalatin
What you waiting for the waiters orders
Say no more for trying to play the wall and quit hating
Git Up Now!
Notice you're sitting, what the fuck is you deaf
You motherfuckers don't listen, I said,
We bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit, procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for get off the wall and quit hating


I keep a shit load of bullets a pitbull to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently
You get burned until I quickly you can not hit me niggas to terrified to come get me,
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,
Inglewood, steepin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone,
I'm still runnin' with stolen toasters while on parole,
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam,
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll,
At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga.


Now it's proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers & mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction rippin' it,
Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile
So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my equittle,
And a glock that ? stop you from waking,
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot native Americans,
A ? nigga, we back in you life and back in your wife,
Hit you in the back with a knife and get it crackin' tonight.

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping
Its D12 is back up in this bitch, uh, there ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalatin
What you waiting for the waiters orders
Say no more for trying to play the wall and quit hating
Git Up Now!
Notice you're sitting, what the fuck is you deaf
You motherfuckers don't listen, I said,
We bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit, procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for get off the wall and quit hating
I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne
My band
My band

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band

The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
(Where'd everybody go?)
The very best of game recordings
The finest in hip hop entertainment
Hello, I'm naughty
One of the sexy sexy game girls you all love to love
And I wanna welcome you to game tight
So, sit back, relax and get your groove on

The Bad
Yeah
The Evil
The Bad
Yeah
The Evil
Right, yo
Put em together

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers 
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm ripping your wallet off 

And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face 
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missing I took it (whoops!)

Nurse look at this straitjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhyming about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defending me

You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated 
It takes six minutes to get applause 
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career 
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on!

I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fucking headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for disaster to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores

This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting

I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my you-haul screaming
"Wait, wait, wait, you ain't moving here!
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?

I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine 
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icing my fame, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace

For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

If it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns,
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one, and
Got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin',
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin',
Willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it
Meant life or death, never live to regret what I
Said, when you're me, people just want to see, if
It's true, if it's you, what you say in your
Rap's, what you do, so they feel, as part of your
Obligation to fulfill, when they see you on the
Streets, face to face, are you for real, in
Confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you
Killed, if you feel it, kill it, if you conceal
It, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you
Full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it, till it's
Empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, I need a good
Reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much,
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up, I'm

Lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off, all
You motherfuckers gotta do is set me off, I'll
Violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off,
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do brings in news,
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two,
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat
Bullets, an excellent method to get rid of the
Next bully, it's actually better cause instead you
Murderin', you can hurt em' and come back again
And kick dirt at 'em, it's like pourin' salt in
The wounds, assault and get sued, you can smell
The lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room,
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops, all you
See is bitches comin' out their halter tops,
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot,
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not,
'Cause

To 'em, give it back to these damn critics and
Sock it to em, I'm like a thug, with a little bit
Of Pac influence, I spew it, and look how I got
You bitches rockin' to it, you motherfuckers could
Never do it like I could do it, don't even try it,
You'll look stupid, do not pursue it, don't ever
In your life, try to knock the truest, I spit the
Illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch, so
Ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock,
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock,
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart
Through this pen, motherfuckers know that I'll
Never be Marshall again, full of controversy until
I retire my jersey, 'til the fire inside dies and
Expires at thirty, and Lord have mercy on any more
Of these rappers that verse me, and put a curse on

Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Yeah! Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that "Detox" album, it's comin'
We goin' make Dre do it (ha ha)
50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin'
Let's go!  Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin' out
Peace!

Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me!

Bye bye!
I never knew I
I never knew I
Mic check one-two
I never knew I

Who woulda knew?
I never knew I
Who'da known?
I never knew I

Fuck who woulda thought?
I never knew I
Motherfucker comes out
I never knew I

And sells a couple of million records
I never knew I
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I never knew I

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (Ah!)

Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?

Oh you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn em around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out

(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up

Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You should of been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
Screamin' "Go" with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the makeup you allow your 12 year old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin' prick!")
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
If 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd
Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees (Hey!)
How many retards will listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a
Teacher, her, him, is it you is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you would of been
If you would of been, in my shoes, who would of thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you would of bought
That would of made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?
Girl you gimme writers block
Im at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no a** as large as yours, how much that cost?
Thats what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers Im about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I cant be apart from her
'Cause nobodies bodys awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause Im popular, but

You know this aint love
Oh no, no this aint love
You know this aint love
You know this aint love (What is it then?) Its desperation

Shes lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(Its desperation)
I cant even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now Im in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I dont see nothin' but you
And Im about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we cant do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, cant, specifically to describe it
I just cant seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Dont wanna be without you, dont wanna be with you neither, b****
Put me in a situation in which its both I wish to seek, 'cause this aint

You know this aint love
Oh no, no this aint love
You know this aint love
You know this aint love (What is it then?) Its desperation

Shes lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(Its desperation)
I cant even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, dont wanna share you with no one else
What the f*** you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean its time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind aint the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
Thats a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffanys
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? What? The lease up
Im just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Hoe thought you was too good for me, huh? 'Til you choosed to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack,
But I cant stomach this Im leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said The f*** with that
Wheres my Louisville Slugger at?
She grabbed that f***in' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and thats technique
She came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would of put a hundred yard field goal, through the uprights

You know this aint love
Oh no, no this aint love
You know this aint love
You know this aint love (What is it then?) Its desperation

Shes lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(Its desperation)
I cant even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again) Its desperation
May I have your attention please? 
May I have your attention please? 
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? 
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up? 
We're going to have a problem here 

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before 
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door 
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture 
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding, 
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" 
And Dr Dre said 
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha) 
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him 
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what 
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though" 
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose 
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't, 
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose 
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips 
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss 
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids 
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is. 
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade, 
They got the discovery channel don't they? 
We ain't nothing but mammals, 
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes. 
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes 
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope 
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote. 
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

[Chorus] 
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records 
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too. 
You think I give a damn about a Grammy? 
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. 
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?" 
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here? 
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears. 
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs 
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst 
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first. 
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V 
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he" 
I should download her audio on mp3 
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D. 
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me 
So I've been sent here to destroy you 
And there's a million of us just like me 
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me 
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing, 
But not quite me 

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 

I'm like a head trip to listen to 
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room 
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all 
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all 
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip) 
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there 
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny 
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty 
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. 
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens 
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working 
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King 
Spitten on your onion rings 
Or in the parking lot circling, 
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up 
So will the real Shady, please stand up 
And put one of those fingers on each hand up 
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control 
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? 

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up, 
Please stand up, 
Please stand up 

Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us, 
Fuck it, 
Let's all stand up
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this)

Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)

(It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute)
(Mm, I don't know!)
(Look baby)
(Damn!)
(Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?)
(Well OK)

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?  (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kid")
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(What the fuck!)
(Grady!)

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell?  Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?  (What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah!  Temper temper!

Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no re-
Morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin' the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-
E-R, just blazin' and we knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And I miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
Homie I'll never forget you (no)

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now for you Doodi is to rap
So I'm a fuck til I die, yeah I'm a do it to death
And itstead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'm a need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'm a show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you
I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And I miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
Homie I'll never forget you (no)
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) shake your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kids rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
Dumb it down, I dont know how (Huh-huh) how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldnt everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl youre fixin' to get your heart broke, dont be absurd man
You bird brained baby I aint called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless youre a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but dont be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials
Creepin' down the back street on these
I got my glock cocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a tech 9 tryin' to take mine
ya want to make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
with their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker i'm Dre
so listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
rollin' in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches, clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by, 'cause I'm too hard to lift
and no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-are-E, from the CPT
on a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as i pop my top ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to POP POP POP
yeah, 'cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse go back and take anothers stop
Cause I'm (Rollin in my six-fo')
with all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
with all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

just another motherfucking day for Dre so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists it's just
that gangster glare, with gangster raps
that gangster shit, that makes the gang of snaps, 
word to the motherfucking streets
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats, that I
hit ya with that I, get ya with
as I groove in my four on these, hitting the switches
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
but before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Reme Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
on my dick, cause my four on hit
pancake front and back, side to side and all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip a nigga trip to the south side, yeah
(Rollin in my six-fo') with all the bitches sayin
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
with all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
on my way to the strip, now I'm just flossing
Checking my rear view, cause niggas they will do
jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching but I just watch them hang
so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak, now everybody
peeping out they windows when they hear me beating up the streets
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say, every single motherfucking day, yo
But I ain't tripping I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I'll be
(Rollin in my six-fo') With everybody saying
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
with all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us the this year, and you know what happened?

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)

Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, passenger side (pistol grip pump)
Fuck it I just did two lines, a chrome tech nine, it'll tear out niggaz spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun, 'cause after it's over
All you gon' hear is *gunshot* run nigga run nigga
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, shit I'm 'bout to score
Cause I'm dangerous, off angeldust, shit I'll bust
Even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my nigga's that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and fuckin' drug dealin'!

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)

I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up shit I could use it (ohhhhh)
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules nigga
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder (murdaaaaa, murdaaaaa)

Sh-sh-sh-shaaaaaady!
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'

Hey, fuck that!
Outsiders

Young Zee
Shady, we're back!

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it bigbabigbig baybababy

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady (Stat Quo!) we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns own, Aftermath, Shady!

Shady!(Bobby Creek!) we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga
Shady! (Ca$his!)

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back nigga
Shady! (Ha! I told you we was back!)
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
One, two, three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
('Cause you know about to rip shit up)
Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a "G" thing, baby!
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy!
Death Row is the label that pays me!
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But uh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have ta' find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
(Yeah) And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hooka's and ho's know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol' funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this and like that and like this and uh,
It's like that and like this and like that and uh,
It's like this
And who gives a fuck about hoes?
So just chill, til the next episode
Fallin' back on that ass, with a hellified gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a ol' batcha' collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah) So Dre, (What up Dog?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton!)

It's where it takes place, so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if yo bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., "No One Can Do It Better"

Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this
And who gives a fuck about hoes?
So just chill, 'til the next episode
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using
She loved booze and alternative music
Told me she was going back to using again
I said wait first try this hallucinogen
Its better then heroin and booze and gin
Come here lets go in here
Who's in the den? (Its me and Kelly)
My bad lets try another room (I don't trust you)
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom

Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods
(Oh hell I might as well try them this party is so drag)
Oh dag I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag (Uh)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world

And now its my fault (My fault)

Yo Sue (Get away from me I don't know you)
Oh shoot she's tripping (I need to go puke)
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susie stop crying I don't hate ya
The world is not against you
I am sorry your father raped you
So you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said (Help me I think I am having a seizure)
I said I am high too bitch
Quit grabbing my t-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me
She said (I am 26 years old and I am not married I don't even have any
Kids and I can't cook)
I am over here Sue
You are talking to the plant
Look we need to get to a hospital
Before it is too late
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

Susie where you going you better be careful

I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these
John where's Dave at before I bash you
He's in the bathroom

There's a girl upstairs talking to plants
Chopping her hair off
And there's only two days left of spring break
How long do these things take to wear off?
Well it depends on how may you've had
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls
Drinking Lysol (She is going to die dude)
I know and its my fault (My god)

I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault (My fault)

I am so sorry I am so sorry
Susie please wake up
What are you doing
Your not dead
A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

Zoning off one joint
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
Shopping the demo with gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
Live in the muck, never giving a fuck
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers)
'Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!

I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit!)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during a earthquake

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!
This is another public service announcement
Brought to you in part by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a fuck)
Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it  you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass!
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
(Yeah)
Uh, anything else?
(Yeah, sue me!)
I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Hi! my name is... (huh?) my name is (what?)
My name is {scratches} Slim Shady

Ahem excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?

Hi kids! do you like violence? (yeah yeah yeah!)
Want to see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (uh-huh!)
Want to copy me and do exactly like I did? (yeah yeah!)
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (huh?)

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which spice girl I want to impregnate 
And Dr. Dre said, "slim shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "so why's your face red? man you wasted!"

Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here slut! (shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, god sent me to piss the world off!

[Chorus]

My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians
Rapin' lesbians while they screamin', "let's just be friends!"

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her (oh thank you!)

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' usher fans 
This guy at white castle asked for my autograph
(dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'dear dave, thanks for the support, asshole!'

[Chorus]

Stop the tape! this kid needs to be locked away! (get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

(Huh yup!) am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide

(Whoops!) clothes ripped like the incredible hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (c'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me mom? (wah!)

You ain't got no tits! (wahhh!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bullet proof vest on and shoot myself in the head (bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (arrrggghhh!)

And by the way when you see my dad? (yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

[Chorus]
Obie Trice.
Real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shot when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating "Hey"
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicated
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
"Testing attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
"Hey" there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Kids!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible?
It feels so good to be back

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel  re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'm a whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all form and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryna tell us something,
Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six

Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-forty seven, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
'Cause I told you to fight.

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator?
Do you guy's hear us? hear us? (Hailie)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that nine it ain't gonna help
What good is it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson  you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Mom! Mom!)
I used to give a, fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E,
'Cause M-T-V was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?
You hear this finger? Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

I take each individual degenerates head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {Back is the incredible!}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Trying to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
"Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin' 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause (I'm) Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ah!)
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back) (Slim Shady!) I'm back

Guess who's b, back, back
Gue' gue' guess who's back (Hi mom!)
Guess who's back
Gue' guess who's back
D-12, Guess who's back
Gue' gue' gue' gue' guess who's back
Dr. Dre, Guess who's back
Back back, back
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt, fuck
[Chorus: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up

[Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outs in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

[Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,

I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?

Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Chorus]

[Slang Ton]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever want to get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills

Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsiders, we hot as Hell's flames is

And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

[Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)

Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)

I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outs for ten thou-sand years
([Pace Won] So done, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear

Lauryn, huh? Hill?
([Pace won] There's more than one?)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Chorus]

[Young Zee]
Yeah
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
'Til she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outs never pay cabs

Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums

Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

[Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace

Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

[Chorus]

[Pace Won]
Come on yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up

Out world baby
Good evening!
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day from
NWA from black and the gray from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking their kegs up from
Racking a bitch to
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry
And I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rapping and tame at me
Shady for us competition
Faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon
A great one
Wait, the day ain't funny man
It's urgent
I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicadin
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane
Vodka and kreatine
Hypnotic and red bull
It's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl
You won't catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie
And as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air
And raise your henny and coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Lets get into it
You smoking with the triest and truest
I got the Midas touch
When it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckas ain't smoking
You just holding shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well puffing ain't enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on
Smoke me out, cuz
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track
They love me when I'm on that stuff
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back (fuck! )
Now look at all the pretty women in here
(Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot
I think we better go check on their temperatures
I give them the thermometer
You get the bandages
Now baby just bend over
This won't hurt a damn bit,

And give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, oh, its impossible
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Show em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
'Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phenomenal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, oh, its impossible
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phenomenal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, oh, its impossible
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person

Got a fuckin mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
'Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

Phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phenomenal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, oh, its impossible
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal
(Don't kill me)

Thank you!

Go, go, go (what the, fuck?)
What the fuck are you doing?
Mothafucker bail on me? Fuck you!

Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me
Are you fucking kidding me?
Shit!
Get off

(Haha)

The parking lot
Shit, ah!
(Let me see your hands, prank's over)
Fuck it!
I sense someone's tapping into my phones why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The F.B.I might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare dead pan look at my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
Mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the Fifth Amendment use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying to fill out in the heroes splinters
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas
He said that he predicted his own death
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By a craze lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know or do they?
Who's they for them to say touche
We're all vulnerable and it's spooky
This is about as kooky as I've ever felt now
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nuttin'
When it's time it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy Number One
"Scalpel"
"Here"
"Sponge"
"Here"
"Wait he's convulsing!" "Ah"
"He's convulsing!"
"Oh my" "We're gonna have to shock him!"
"Oh my God!" "We're gonna have to shock him!"
"Oh my God!"

These are the results of a thousand electric volts,
A neck with bolts "Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse!"
A kid who refused to respect adults,
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose.
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery,
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me.
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack.
My first day in junior high, this kid said,
"Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch it was one twenty,
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first.
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"
"What's the matter?" "I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"
"Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."
"But don't you want to give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'm a let him"

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailey,
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey.
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes,
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers.
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin',
And had me in the position to beat me into submission.
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat.
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe.
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honky!"
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me.
I made them think they beat me to death,
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left.
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth.
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws.
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools.
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good.
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could,
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood.
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot.
Made it home later that same day.
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray.
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read.
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed.
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control,
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull.
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry son" "Shut up you cunt!"
I said, "Fuck it!" took it and stuck it back up in my head,
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck.

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

It' brain damage, I got brain damage
It's brain damage,
It's probably brain damage.
Ayo Before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?

Yea yeah
Woah wah
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh)
Woah wah
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew that I was going through growin' pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself
He was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank God that I didn't do it
I would've had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talkin to the wall though
I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talkin to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto
He's not a desperado he's desperate, it's starting to bottle inside 'em
One foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady
I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing em out
I've come to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I've let em down
So please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep ya head up,
T.I., keep ya head up, Kanye, keep ya head up,
Don't let up, keep slayin' 'em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

So there it is (there it is)
Damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ay yo
And to anybody who thought about going there, 
It was never nothing personal, 
Some shit I was going through
And to everybody else
I'm back! (I'm back) haha
Yeah, we should do something like that

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

Yeah, we should do something like that

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeroes and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' dem pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, kiss my black ass

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, to shitty parts,
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tear you're ass apart!
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch,
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick,
Teflon wrapped on, 'case I get clapped on,
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home,
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,
If I can whip the kick to spit sicker sick flows,
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay,
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,
I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile,
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats,
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady
Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'mma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eating
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

See honey: there's a place called "heaven" and a place called "hell"
A place called "prison" and a place called "jail"
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nahhh)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

Wake up, sweepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!
What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, b****, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them b****es
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
"I remember it clearly, even today"
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a f***ing clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, f*** them stupid Pumas b****, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new s***, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his s***
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this s***
Never quit, too persistent
Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this s***
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching s***
I f***ing got that b**** in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like c***suckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle b**** I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, s*** no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird s***,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the f***ing jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a f***ing yarn
So mow the f***ing lawn, your a**es are blades of grass
And I'm f***ing up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey
There's not much you could do or say to phase me 
People think I'm a little bit crazy 
I get it from all angles in a while to save me 
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think 
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me 
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me 
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy 
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast 'cause my mind is racing 
And I could give a fuck what category you place me 
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone 
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me 
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me 
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me 
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me 
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me 
It only made me what I am today, see 
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
You ain't gonna make or break me 
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G 
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me 
You had all this time to think about it 
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me 
Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day 
That we finally meet in the same place to see 

No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many M-C's I end up 
Ooh ooh, it's never enough 

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it 
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics 
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split 
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it 
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit 
Graze it, your peace talk, save it 
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated 
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers 
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy? 
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it 
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic 
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it 
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate 
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it 
When it's hot, it's hot 
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it
WHOOOO!!!
Hey, how you guys doin.
You want more?
Alright, then SHUT UP!!!

Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)
Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)
Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)
Shoobeedoo Shoobee Snoobedeebeebop

Girl (girl, girl, girl)
Your My World (world, world world)
Your My Girl (girl, girl girl)
Your my world, world world.

Here's a song for da ladies.
We touch I feel a rush
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous,
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
I've tried in this department but
I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake

('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts,
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you,
Let down my guards swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you
Aw baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shakin' that ass to that new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door
But I don't think I'm a answer
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing,
What do you mean freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest
I am agreeing Mr. Officer,
I'm already on my knees,
I can't get on the ground any further
It's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer,
I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make R and B I sing song It goes
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
If I offend I'm sorry,
Please, please forgive
For I am Triumph the puppet dog
I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and
You will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
Jessica Simpson,
Looks so-so tempting,
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that,
Every time I see that show on MTV my peepee goes
Da-doing doing doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome,
Now they're getting older they're starting
To grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
Jeez I just got my seat I have ticket look,
I put it away my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this
Movie theater please
I did not even get to see, Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or
Make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Peewee Herman
This movie's P-G
Mr. Officer I demand to see my attorney,
I will simply plead innocent
Cop a plea and be free, free, yes, free
Right back on the streets,
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael
He's too busy?
I am Triumph,
Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand (Ha ha)

[Chorus]

The way she moves she dances like a go-go,
In the video she sings
"Get out you bozo"
I need a new boyfriend hi my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch
I just baked cookies, Mr. Officer,
Lookie, take a whiff of these,
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this,
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee
Pee, On the radio, but I think I did,
Janet, is that a breast?
I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
I don't think my joke is working
I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold get down!

[Chorus]

What the fuck is wrong wit' chu?  (Ha ha ha)
Yeah,
You know technically
I'm not even supposed to be here right now
So fuck it
Might as well make the most of it

Yeah, ha ha,
Feels good, whoo
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get second chance
But I ain't blowing this one
Nah man
Shit I feel like I can do anything now)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cause I get ticked
It's a rap I was down, when I was down I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin' and blowin' kisses cause your flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
Or otherwise I'm just knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva what can you do
Go get your crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you
Now guess who (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
He's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name

Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Pause don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
Cinderella man

Cinderella man send to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story, nor did he
Come to do the same, can't afford to be a label in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say goodbye to the old H-I to the new case or I
Consider it his last hurray
The coupe de gras, raise 'em high, in the sky
Keep 'em up time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient I will make no more mistakes, shit my
Potatoes they call me the veggies on my plate can fly
My fillet is smokin' weed, get back if the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin' image I mirror it
When I stand near it,
Your pussy lyric I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's all up in your ass, he's in your psyche too
Now what's his name

If I had a time machine

Meet eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store.
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
("s*** is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this")

Alright, stop! (huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (but who are you?)
I'm your motherf***in conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than george burns

F*** that! do that s***! shoot that b****!
Can you afford to blow this s***? are you that rich?
Why you give a f*** if she dies? are you that b****?
Do you really think she gives a f*** if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!	(you're right!)
Not over this s*** (stop!) drop the biscuit (i will!)
Don't even listen to slim yo, he's bad for you
(you know what dre? I don't like your attitude..)

("It's alright see'mon, just come in here for a minute")
("I don't know!")
("Look baby..")
("Damn!")
("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")
("Well ok..")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. ("give me a kiss!")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play... ("s***!")

Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
And smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little b****'s earlobe..
(Yo! this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair? (uh huh!)
F*** this b**** right here on the spot bare
'Til she pa**es out and she forgot how she got there

(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _kids_?)
No, but I seen the porno with sundoobiest!
(s***, you want to get hauled off to jail?)
Man f*** that, hit that s*** raw dawg and bail..

Meet grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.

("What the f***?!?!")
("Grady!!")

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

F*** that s***, you just caught this b**** cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
F*** slittin her throat, cut this b****'s head off!!!

Wait! what if there's an explanation for this s***?
(what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?!)
Alright shady, maybe he's right grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay! thought about it, still want to stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes??!

What'chu say? (what's wrong?	 didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherf***er!

Uhhh-aahh! temper temper!
Mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.?
Mr. ak comin' straight outta compton why'all better make way?
How in the f*** you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw f*** it...
What am I sayin' shoot em both grady, where's your gun at?
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmo who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dumb da dumb da da 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Remember me? ("There been executions")
Remember me? ("I have no remorse")
Remember me? ("I'm high, power!")
Remember me? ("I drop bombs like Hiroshima")

For this, why it's the X, you retarded?
'Cause I grab the mic and get down, like syndrome
Hide in Rome and to the masses, without boundaries
Which qualifies me for the term "universal"
Without no rehearsal, colleague words is controversial
Like I'm not, the one you want to contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got "Banned From TV"
Heavyweight get up, watch you're whole head split up
Loco is the motion, weed comin' through
Hollow tips in the lead, the .45 through
Remember me? ("Throw ya guns in the air!")
Remember me? ("Slam! Slam!")
Remember me? ("Nigga back da fuck up!")
Remember me? ("Chka-chka-Onyx!")

Niggas catchin' "no" for an answer, ghetto no
Yeah, I've been told no but it's more like
"No, no, no!!"
Life's a bitch, yeah it'll fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This ved is a head, the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
I better extended the cheddars and credda
Instead of vendetta, a mellow beretta from ghetto to gutter
Evidence? Nope! Never leave a shredda
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me and hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dike bitches total
Want beef, nigga? Psh better dead that shit
My name should be "Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit"
Probably say "he ain't a killa", but I'm killin' myself
Smoke def, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'm a do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a bullet too
What you want to do, cocksuckers? We're glockbusters
'Til the cops cuff us, gonna start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

Remember me? ("I just don't give a fuck!")
Remember me? ("Yeah, fuck you too!")
Remember me? ("I'm low down and I'm shifty!")
Remember me? ("I'm shady!")

When I go out, I'm a go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image,
So I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say "fuckin'" for six minutes
(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blond
So I made me a song, killed her and put Haley on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?)
Came home, and somebody must've broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
With M-16's with ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clintin's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that! Psh you fagots can vanish to volcanic ash
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas, and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)
Don't you remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?!
Remember me?!
(Coughs)
Yeah,
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
Yeah, I feel it too.
Damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
Ha ha

I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
I'm right back on 'em, with the
I can't call it
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Now, it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

I'm so bad

I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
To appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm so bad

I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on the, biggest days, they came to see you spit your game
Ooh
It shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn, is it that time again already?
Ha ha, you don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck y'all then

Shawty dance while I dis you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddha, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker
I'll show you pussy footin', I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a fagot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
(Man chill) nah I can't god dammit
Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you're fake, ah what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ah what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, til then I drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know, I don't know what caused,
I don't know what caused me to be this way to be this way
I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me
Yeah
Ya know?
Critics man,
Critics never got nothin' nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man?
Is, critics never ask me how my day went
Well I'm a tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro'
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spider man throwin' a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-Rida
Inside a low rida with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt
So get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin' up everyone else's cold

Yuh, I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song its a warnin' to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mister Mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to thinkin that you can stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you, this ain't savage you ain't never seen the brute
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut, boo
Sayin' you sick quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me cause these hos wont even dare
I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Micheal's hair

Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebbecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector
I said nice rectum
I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector in the guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya
They said once bitten n twice shy
We lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser
It's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop, kick the bits before a second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again

How should I begin it and were does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said

Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends

All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showin' up
So you better change the station
To keep from throwin' up
Man you seen it all before your alter a million with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't
I won right by the Pussy Cat Dolls "When call you kitten"
I'll pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room
Crazy glue in Madonna to
The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine if visual for that man
Who woulda thought
Could ever be such a relentless prick
And leashin' his fingers
For the chicks who waltz
She looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be
Your so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and knee him right into quick sand
Here you need a hand big man grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez

Obie, yo

Bitches
Gettin' sick

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis
Denise from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should of seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable,
French role stylin', body like a Stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigga
Debatin' on to fuck, or do I wanna be a nigga
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit
I ain't use to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' ho's money, but that's anutha story
For surely ya pussy on toast, after we toast
her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beata', clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotta' than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knockin' it
Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owna'
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighta' than conditions of us black folks
we in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit
Fuck

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'
Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleanas
Bringin' me home diseases swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit this ho's a genius
She gee'd us

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs

Shady Records

Obie Trice
Eminem motherfucker
New millennium shit

Turn this shit the fuck off
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that, what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I want to kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it
Or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that
Then I'll kill you
You know why?

Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal
You god damn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That will stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or les'
Or the homo-sex, hermaph', or a trans'a'vest'
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just hetero phobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum,
you'll never get hold of 'em
Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it?  checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second L.P sends you directly to jail?
Come on! relax guy, I like gay men
Right, ken?  give me an amen (amen!)
Please lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch t.v, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new C-D for these fuckin' retards
Duh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. "Don't give a fuck," still won't leave

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal !
An animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd want to fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went, when the president got oral
Sex in his oval office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blond-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy, who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim shady, I'm as crazy as em-
Inem and Kim combined the maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
(mm-mm-mm!) oh, that's Dre with an A.K to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that will teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal
Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo 'em

Don't kill nobody this time

Aw'right, god damn, fuck
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!

What?  oh my god, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Don't kill me, please don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Hurry the fuck up! {boom} thank you!
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'm a be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

"Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
Shady! Yeah
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Now homie I say I run (it run) it 'cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
It's nuttin' but some cash

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know what this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of Tony Yayo, go
Lyrics
Ayo, this song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this Tec at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
When snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
Cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half a life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin', deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burnin' in hell, scorchin' in flames
If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got em
I'm screaming like them two cops when 2Pac shot em
Holding 2 Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on em
And while you flaunt em I could be takin' em to shops to pawn em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want em?
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear
When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me!  I'm a be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too!  You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'm a kill you!  Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops!  Is that a subliminal hint?  No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
Twice?  Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots!  I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that!  I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up!  Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know, I love you
Girl you gimme writers block
Im at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
Thats what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers Im about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I cant be apart from her
'Cause nobodies bodys awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause Im popular, but

You know this aint love
Oh no, no this aint love
You know this aint love
You know this aint love (What is it then?) Its desperation

Shes lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(Its desperation)
I cant even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now Im in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I dont see nothin' but you
And Im about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we cant do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, cant, specifically to describe it
I just cant seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Dont wanna be without you, dont wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which its both I wish to seek, 'cause this aint

You know this aint love
Oh no, no this aint love
You know this aint love
You know this aint love (What is it then?) Its desperation

Shes lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(Its desperation)
I cant even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, dont wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean its time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind aint the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
Thats a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffanys
You better have an epiphany
Daddy what are you doing?
Okay then!
Everybody listen up!
I'm goin' to hell!
Who's comin' with me?
Somebody please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high,
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you,
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off,
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall,
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off (Suck it, Marshall).
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby,
My Dad's Lost It!

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

It's like my mother always told me and codeine and
Goddammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin' dick,
Chew on a prick and lick
A million mutherfuckin' cocks per second,
I'd rather put out a mutherfuckin' Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy,
And have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo,
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
Dad

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time,
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work,
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,
And kicked and hit with shit every time
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on.
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids love it.
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy
Crazy
Ha ha ha
You're funny daddy!
I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeed fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million

Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous 'cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many
People ever give a shit but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out

Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, asshole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it

But what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the count
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting

Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock
Just to go out watch Batman

Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo

My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin' we have some magnetic pull
Then scream' ICP in this bitch, how the fuck do magnets work!?
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen? That ain't practical

You crackin' a joke, it's laughable, 'cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina,
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor

Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, 'cause you're on my ass
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
And it ain't never gonna stop.

A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime,
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster

I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not be, rude off
So fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird,
You stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama I'm a make you look so ridiculous now

[Chorus: x2]
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

I got some skeletons in my closet and
I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' C-D
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today!
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cause I'd a killed them, shit I woulda shot Kim and him both
This my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus: x2]

Now I would never dis my own mama
Just to get recognition
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
Well guess what your gettin' older now and
It's cold when your lonely and Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that your phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead, dead to you as can be!

[Chorus: x2]
[Eminem]
Yo, Slim Shady!
Yo, I'll fuckin, I'll
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fuckin' ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin' G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you,
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin' up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses
And close it back with a lit match in it
While I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray every night (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickel nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Chorus]

[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

(Chorus:Repeat x2)

But every time I take a step it gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!
How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
ain't no way no how, this bullshit can be true
We family and ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just can't describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and i don't like it

It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasn't with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like why'all was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggas musta hurt you pride or somethin
'cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i ain't you man and lyin like she can't be loose
But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth
But don't hate the game or the player
'cause the one that is changing is you

You're only at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys ain't starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
(how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face
Tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you

Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Can't you see what you do to me baby,
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex
You make me crazy
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire
It's baby, because you stay with me
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chill you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You didn't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in love

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table,
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alana to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh
Convict
Up front

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow.
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo.
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo.
And possibly bend you over.

To ring the Campbell like Naomi
Just do that girl
And take it on easy
Take it all oiled up
And all greasy
'Bout that time
You start that teasin'
Way that you droppin'
Got me cheesin'
But for me you takin' all my money for real
I'd rather spend it on you right now
Than my homies bail
And I can see that's what you made for
And ain't never been no lame ho
But that booty bought and paid for
One move to you on my payroll

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow.

Move to it like you used to it
Drop it down

To the crib we go
Go fast and slow
Make it turn like a stripper
Slide down my pole
Shortie ass so slow
Got you boiled like whoa
One night with me
She wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no
Let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through
And tap that hole
Make it lose control
All the girls know
That I hit it right at night
I'm a pro
I only come round to get sexual
And she flexible
And I'm sexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that murk that work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow.
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo.
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo.
And possibly bend you over.

Smack that, oooh.

Bobby Creek - you know what I'm saying
The ice in the watch
Reflects the light to her
The money quite green
And the ice like blue
The swag might kill her
So I say goodnight to her
She don't want me to leave
I can see right through her
So we dip out
Burn one trip back
Get low like Caribbean
Limbo then go
Out like light
Baby girl get right
Head so slow my hat don't fit right
We cruise in the car
Or we could take flight
The middle of the night
Make your body ache like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king
Cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care
Listen baby it's a fact
That
If you drop back
I'm a quarterback sack that
We can go deep
And I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where the keys
And your hat at?
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow.
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo.
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo.

It fits perfect
Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin' and I'm packin' in my lunch a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, "Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin' down to Frank Sinatra."
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked while you let me watch ya?
Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks,
"Mista, help me"'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin' them and cuttin' them up in chunks,
In clumps, the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit, em all into such a small place?
Hide em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',
You can even hear the evil spirits comin' from within.
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.
Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin', so chill.
Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearin' voices, like "Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?"
"In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin' with?
Duck, because here he comes again.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Maxine!

Hello 
Can I speak to Maxine? 
Yeah this is me what's up? 
What up? 

Who dis? 
Denaun 
Yeah what's up? 
What are you doing? 

Nothing just laying in bed 
Huh? 
Nothing just laying in bed 
Why? 

I don't know thinking about something freaky to do 

I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine 
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean 
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly 

If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation 
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation 
When you step away son, she got her face done 
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if 

You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you 
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice 
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency 
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee 

Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it 
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!) 

Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is 
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit 
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night 
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down 

And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be 
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that 
When you got niggas hiding in your closet 
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely 

I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me 
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies 
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number 

I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch.. 
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands 
And said "Oh it's like that?" 

She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit 
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit 
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number 
She asked could I give her mine too 

Got to the crib and called her up 
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck 
I said "Maxine check this out, 
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out" 

Got to the crib she let me in 
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom 
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.
What the fuck are you doing?" 

So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing 
As she went for my midsection 
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work 

Before I hit it she said 
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass" 
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok" 
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS" 
I got up out 

Hey, Maxine 
What 
You thinking about sucking my dick? 
Yeah for a small price 

For a small price? What you mean? 
You know, money nigga 
You don't need no damn money, 
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit. 

What you, what you hear I got? 
AIDS 
Who told you that bullshit? 
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie 

Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then 
Oh for real, it's like that? 
Well I ain't got shit, 
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga 

Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you 
No, see.. 
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you 
Hold on, why it ain't even like that 

I want ya'll to get paid, fucking
One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some f***in' one "ouch"
What the f***'d you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
S*** I laughed in his face spit
B**** gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your a** back in that game
B**** don't take s*** for granted
And don't take s***, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how f***ing bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your a** and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you f***in' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished b****
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a f***ing booger though
Just to wipe that b**** on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that b**** from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of s***
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this f***ing English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this s***
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the f***ing recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
F*** it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
S*** legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
S*** that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
F*** mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this f***ing earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll f***ing flip on ya
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are six critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an' I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly, like (Beyonce's) pot belly
This is destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah I'm a basketcase and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted,
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
Fourty four mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC
It's what it do just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a real MC
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an' mourning
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded
All they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
An' they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', an' you too, you can

Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (Woo!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
With this like winning a huge meet
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think

'Cause I'm, I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G 
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherf***er you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, f*** it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your a**
B****, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the f*** out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherf***in throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus]
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' s*** out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a f***in' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
F*** droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherf***in' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of b****es
Sick of naggin' bosses b****in' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Hey, f*** that!
Outsiders
Pace one
Young Zee
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it. If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfucking bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, 'cause

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, 
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this

Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin up in the urinal (you fuckin' homo'!)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed (killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville ('Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (filled)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill! (Hill!)
We don't do drive-by's, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too!
That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (here??)
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year? (year?)
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen,
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it (Ah!)
God dammit, he meant it when he told you!

Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville (I'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mm.
You high baby?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Ha ha ha.
Talk to me.
You want me to tell you somethin'.
Uh huh.
I know what you wanna hear.

'Cause I know you want me baby 
I think I want you too.
I think I love you baby.
I think I love you too.
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world.

Oh boy you drive me crazy.

Bitch you make me hurl.

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now

I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

Don't get me wrong
I love these hoes
It's no secret
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby

I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world

Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not phased,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade. I love that name,
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too.
I think I love you baby.
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world.
Oh boy you drive me crazy.
Bitch you make me hurl.

I'm a Rock Star
Baby baby baby I'm a rock star
Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' 
my rock car
Coz I'm a rock star
baby baby baby I'm a rock star

[Verse 1]
Where's Marshall? Who the hell cares?
Bizarre's on stage, shakin' his derrier
I'm a rock star, trust my belly
Hugs and kisses get my clothes all sweaty
I'm the man, the lead singer of the band
On stage, for thousands of fans
Or you could be dancin' for Hammar
If you look you could see me in the camera
Actin' like Luther Vandross
Anything to get them clothes off
The fans want Bizarre, they don't want him
I'm backstage makin' out with Kim

[Corus]
I'm a Rock Star
Baby baby baby I'm a rock star
Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' 
my rock car
Coz I'm a rock star
Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star
jumpin' jumpin' jumpin'
my rock car
rooooooooooock and roooolllllllll

[Verse 2]
The girls are gazing, its so amazing
Black, white, thirteen to eighteen
I'm on TRL with David Chappellle
Talkin' bout the little two days I did in jail
Give me a sandwich, feed me lunch
[Want some water]
Girl where's my punch?
If I don't get punch, you gon' get punched (ooooh shit !)
Matter fact forget lunch
The guy with the shower cap runnin' the streets
Big ol' stomache, they all know me
Last video, I was in the back
Now I started a group with Horney Mac [sp??]

[Corus]
I'm a Rock Star
Baby baby baby I'm a rock star
Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin'

[Verse 3]
Me and 50 workin' out
Show you what the rock stars all about
Its been awhile, I'm comin' out
Doin' laps around Jimmy Iovene's house
I don't drive, I got a chauffer to pick me up
Big ol' truck that's all beat up
cadillac with a Diamond in the Back
"Dr. Dre's on line one" tell him to call me back
I'm too busy to take his call
I'm at the mall, collectin' girls' drawers
This Rock Star stuff is the life for me
May 27th, buy my cd

[Corus]
I'm a Rock Star
Baby baby baby I'm a rock star
Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' 
my rock car

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

Yea

You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Yea

My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurricular
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum

Umm

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh, Those were the days they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

So I'm sayin
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)
All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement, haha
I'll meet you down there
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows Dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it fake it
They get so mad, when I call them both fagots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin'-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator
I want you, to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumping
I want the fists, pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to fill ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
{*chka-chk-chk*} What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them, cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
Cause this shit's getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-didi-da-da-da-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Like chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song's like a seance, it hums
(It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off for what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man ain't that the truth, girl your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur-ur-during the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' ho
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
"E" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick
Right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, "Dre fell off", that's news to me

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown
Shady lose
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?"

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
"I dont like this, no!"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Shit,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!

Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What is it all mean
I can almost taste it
I can almost tame it

This shit makes no sense to me
What is it all mean
I can almost taste it

Yeah, can't stop now
(I can almost taste it)
This maybe the last time I get,
(I want to be famous)

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigamortis and post-mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to flaunt 'em
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some prank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
You call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it, you were just in his C-D's
Laugh at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady E-P's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He is almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the pain off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these brauds
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the LeBron so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ah
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can get a belt or neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get a stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords
So bare witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous
Morning, Marshall
Morning, Doc
So we're discharging you today; how are you feeling?
Anxious
Anxiety?
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world, nervous
Nervous? Come on, Marshall, you're a big boy now, sounding like a bit of a baby
You can do this; you found a sponsor yet?
Um, not yet, I mean, but when I get back
Well, if you find one, you find one; if you don't, you don't
Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and
Wait, what?
Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
And it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule
We know you're a busy person
But I thought variety was the most important thing?
So what else are you thinking?
Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps
And, I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them
Steps?
Yeah, steps
There's a lot of them, aren't there?
Well, twelve
Christ, I don't even know them all
Really?
Anything else?
Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
Take a drink
What?
Take a drink and, you know, take the edge off
Take the edge off?
Man, if I ever take a drink, I already know what that's gonna lead me to
What, you mean these?
Man, what the fuck?
Marshall, what's the matter, darling?
Having some doubts already?
Marshall, you can't leave me
You'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall
Marshall? Marshall?
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, shit
Okay
I am going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me

Mic check 1, 2
We recording?
I'm cancerous
So when I dis you, you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death and I choked you again
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off the funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean i lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue
Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there, I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sigh
Either I'm high, or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop it off with this solo shit it's over with
I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I've been with ten women who got H-I-V
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree
You probably want to grow up and be just like me
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or albino, yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to it, and I was like (Oh Yeah)

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'Go get 'em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryin' to fight momentum?'
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir!
So full of joy, why am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)

Yo' homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair
Yo' friends shoulda known not to front 'round here
You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here
Man I'm a say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Yo' girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up playa
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere)
What is life? 
Life is like a big obstacle 
In front of your optical to slow you down 

And every time you think you gotten past it 
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground 
What are friends? 
Friends are people that you think are your friends 
But they really your enemies, with secret identities 
And disguises, to hide they true colors 
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin' 

What is money? 
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil 
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down 

What is life? 
I'm tired of life 
I'm tired of backstabbing a** snakes with friendly grins 
I'm tired of committing so many sins 
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins 
Tired of never having any ends 
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things 
I'm tired of this DJ playing your s*** when he spins
Tired of not having a deal 
Tired of having to deal with the bulls*** without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo 
I'm tired of motherf***ers spraying s*** and dartin' off 
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour 
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off 
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk 
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk 
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire 
But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 

If I had a magic wand, 
I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, 
While I'm on the john 
If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, 
Because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor 
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store 
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home 
To have one in if I did have it on 
Tired of not driving a B-M 
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him 
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M 
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour 
Tired of f***ing the same blond whore
After work in the back of a Contour 
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones 
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns 

Tired of being stared at 
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat 
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz 
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me 
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me 
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs 
Tired of J-L-be	 saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives" 

But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john 

If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 
You know what I'm saying? 
I'm tired of all of this bulls*** 
Telling me to be positive 
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see s*** positive? 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
I rap about s*** around me, s*** I see 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city 
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'? 
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Just fed up 
That's my word
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
Im here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (for sure)
And I cant let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
Right we wanna love alcohol
We wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

I love the burners
The money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold ya
I just wanna love ya
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em 
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen 
Got murdered in cold blood 
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home 
They say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
And on a quiet night 
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9\"

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
Trapped him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 
Til' the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
Told him each one of his boys is dead 
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said 

Who hard? yo I done heard worse 
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
To see which one will swerve first 
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds 
That of a globe, on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is 'hell-ier' than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse 
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse 
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
We hit the trees til' we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
(shit, me neither) 
We ain't eager to be legal 
So please leave me wi't the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain (He's insane) 
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
'Cause I can't find a decent vein

The disaster wit' dreads 
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
To kill my soul after I'm dead 
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
'Cause I serve any stranger wit' money 
I spray a hundred, men until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws 
Wit' my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass 
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's 
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me 
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche 
And bust till volcanoes erupt
Hello? (Billy) 
'Ay-yo what's up (we're comin' to get you) 
Stop they know it's us! 

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-huh) 
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh) 
Well I'm out now (shit)
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up 
And I ain't gonna leave you a window to jump out of 
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms 
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave 
I'm a put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel 

(We'll be waitin') 
See you in hell 
Wall Street, 
Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady 
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye) 
Bad meets evil, what? ('till next time)

And so that's the story when bad meets evil 
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon 
But their spirits still live on to this day 
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ah-yo this song is for anyone 
Fuck it just shut up and listen 

Ah-yo 
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags 
And this bag, of this weed , 
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest M-C on this 
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve 
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it, 
The stress has been eating me, recently 
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 
When you freaks see me out in the streets, 
When I'm eating or feedin' my daughter to not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuck anything 
I'm not Mr. 'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think 
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 
Go call you a lawyer, 
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you, 
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, It's just me 

And I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems 
Like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky 
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'Cause they full of shit too 
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school 
And they blame it on Marilyn 
And the heroin, where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at 
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

And I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is" 
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
And I just do not got the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to? What hood I grew up in? The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
You've been driving me crazy, 
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit 
In the bathroom without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am
Yo, yeah girl,
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?

You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

(My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)

I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

(My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above,
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

(My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhethers pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
Its curtains, Im inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?
Uh oh yeah 
Oh suck it 
Oh f*** you

Oh this is why they call you two dope ain't it

[Dr. West:] Morning, Marshall.

[Eminem:] Morning, doc.

[Dr. West:] So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?

[Eminem:] Anxious.

[Dr. West:] Anxiety?

[Eminem:] Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous.

[Dr. West:] Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?

[Eminem:] Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back

[Dr. West:] Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't.

[Eminem:] Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?

[Dr. West:] Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, we know you're a busy person.

[Eminem:] But I thought variety was the most important thing?

[Dr. West:] So what else are you thinking?

[Eminem:] Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them.

[Dr. West:] Steps?

[Eminem:] Yeah, steps.

[Dr. West:] There's a lot of them, aren't there?

[Eminem:] Well, twelve.

[Dr. West:] Christ, I don't even know them all.

[Eminem:] Really?

[Dr. West:] Anything else?

[Eminem:] Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?

[Dr. West:] Take a drink.

[Eminem:] What?

[Dr. West:] Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off.

[Eminem:] Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to.

[Dr. West:] What, you mean these? *shakes pills*

[Eminem:] Man, what the fuck!?

[Dr. West:] Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall?... Marshall!?

[Eminem:] No, no, no, no, NO!
Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up all over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else. I'm back! Ha ha
Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
(I'm Slim Shady) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot (uh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'm a come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I like happy things,
I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things
That make me happy and gleeful (he he he)
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hm)
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aw that shit is wack!)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
(What? That's my shit!)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
And if I told you I had aid y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack (uh-uh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uh)
She's still alive and bitchin' (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being aids infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

(Ha ha ha ha)
I told you I was Shady!
(Ha ha)

Y'all didn't wanna believe me!
I'm Shady!
And that's my name
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
Thats why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So Im non complying at home, at school Im just shy and awkward
And no I dont need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
Im outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
Theres no guarantee, its not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I dont give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I aint walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
Theres no guarantee, its not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my

Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
Theres no guarantee, its not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
Motherfuckers
Say that I'm foolish
I only talk about jewels
(Bling bling)
Do you fools
Listen to music or
Do you just skim
Through it?
See I'm influenced
By the ghetto you ruined
That same dude
You gave nothin'
I made somethin' doin'
What I do through
And through and
I give you the news
With a twist
It's just his
Ghetto point-of-view
The renegade
You been afraid
I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer
To the block where they
Pop toasters
And they live
With they moms
Got dropped roasters
From botched robberies
Niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up
Cause she wasn't
Watched over
Knocked down
By some clown
When child support knocked
No he's not around
Now how that
Sound to ya?
Jot it down
I bring it
Through the ghetto
Without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down duckin' strays
From frustrated youths
Stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine
That fucked up my day
How you rate music
That thugs with
Nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way
Through it, not you
Can't step in my pants
Can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth
You lose your tie
And your shirt
Since I'm in a position
To talk to these kids
And they listen
I ain't no politician
But I'll kick it
With 'em a minute
Cause see they
Call me a menace
And if the shoe fits
I'll wear it
But if it don't
Then you'll will
Swallow the truth
Grin and bear it
Now who's these
King of these rude
Ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title
Put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it
Sharin' his views
And his merits
But there's
A huge interference
They're sayin'
You shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew
Maybe it's food
For the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music
I made for you
To just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated
And viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict
Like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when
You start to stare at
Who's in the mirror
And see yourself
As a kid again
And you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do
But make you look
Stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders
Too bad you couldn't
Do good at marriage
(Ha ha)
And do you
Have any clue
What I had to do
To get here?
I don't think you do
So stay tuned and
Keep your ears
Glued to the stereo
Cause here we go
He's
(Jigga joint Jigga-chk-Jigga)
And I'm the sinister
Mr. Kiss-My-Ass
It's just the

[Chorus]
Renegade
Never been afraid
To say
What's on my mind
At any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid
To talk about anything
(Anything)
Anything
(Anything)
Renegade
Never been afraid
To say
What's on my mind
At any given time of day
Cause I'm a (Renegade)
Never been afraid
To holler about anything
(Anything?)
Anything
(Anything)

I had to hustle
My back to the wall
Ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with
A lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent
Lot of innocent of lives
Lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin'?
Gotta pay rent
Bring dollars in
By the bodega
Iron under my coat
Feelin' braver
Doo-rag
Wrappin' my waves up
Pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward
I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan
My momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me
I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights
I brought somethin' home
To quiet the
Stomach rumblings
My demeanor
Thirty years my senior
My childhood
Didn't mean much
Only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics
Raisin' my head to the sky
Big I did it
Multi before I die (nigga)
No lie, just know
I chose my own fate
I drove by the
Fork in the road
And went straight

See I'm a poet to some
A regular
Modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the
King of these
Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture
In which of that
As they paint me
As a monger of hate and
Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case
See it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide
If Shady's as bad
As they say he is
Or is he the latter
A gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat
Who they can
Be mad at today
See it's easy as cake
Simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol
At sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons
Take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water
No wonder they try
To hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful
Delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube
Motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do?
(Huh?)
I'm just a kid
From the gutter
Makin' this butter
Off these bloodsuckers
Cause I'm a muh'fuckin'

[Chorus: x2]
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey,
What daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
Yeah
Make my vocals sound sexy
Come on man, come on man okay

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong cos it feels so right
But its all right its OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking my ball and going home home

I'm that guy man
Shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mud holes in ya ass girl
Now lets cuddle
Blood curdlin' you're gurglin' on your blood
What I do for my next trick
I'm filling one duffle
I think I might just do something a little less subtle
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her
In my spider-man mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachio's damn I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on
God damn man are you that much of an asshole

[Chorus]

I'm like Houdini
Tuck my teenyeenyweeny between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini believe me homie
You don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Wiener smothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice
You should have seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos

[Chorus]

Shady what are you doing chewing on a human
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back boom
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a raccoon
Skewing a rat or cat screwing a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he didn't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance I'm back doing my dance ooh
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read eighty four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
Cos I'm scared there's monster's under my bed
Kelly Pickler hit my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dike well I can pee pee and write your name

[Chorus]
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ey yo this song is for anyone 
Fuck it just shut up and listen 

Ey yo 
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags 
And this bag, of this weed 
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this 
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve 
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently 
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing 
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think 
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you 
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me 

And I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems 
Like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky 
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'Cause they full of shit too 
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school 
And they blame it on Marilyn 
And the heroin, where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at 
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

And I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is" 
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
And I just do not got the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
You've been driving me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit 
In the bathroom without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ah-yo  this song is for anyone 
Fuck it just shut up and listen 

Ah-yo 
I sit back with this pack of zigzags 
And this bag of this weed 
It gives me the shit needed to be 
The most meanest M-C on this on this earth 
'Cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self 
To relieve all this tension dispensing me 
Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently

No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be 
It's just me

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is" 
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations 
And I just do not have the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to? 
What hood I grew up in? 
The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 
You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it 
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get 
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph 
You can call me an asshole 
I'm glad cause 

And I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am
[Intro]
Yo check this out! In life, you got your want to be's
You got your going to be's, and you got your has been's
Then you got your hustlers and hardcore

[Domingo]
Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!

Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt

[Chorus: x4]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!

[Domingo]
Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
I'll manner bad grammar stander

Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding under clothes in dirty hampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
Shit nappers

[Eminem]
I'll puke eat and freak you
Battle, I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you

And force feed you them both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a round house
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
I ain't no fucking g, I'm a canibal

I ain't trying to shoot you, I'm trying to chop you into pieces and eat you
Rap you in rope and glass, strapped to a soakin matress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis

[Chorus: x4]

[Domingo]
Aw yeah
Oh! Yeah,
So much for 1st single on this one

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of 'erp
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Butterworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-On-Christopher-Reeves-Just-For-No-Reason
Other than to just tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (burp) fan
He used to be Superman
Now I'm pourin' liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem you wait til we meet up again
Fucker I'm kicking your ass for everything you've ever said"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show
Ready get set let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers I told ya
I'm about to blow so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers it's dominoes
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where the Eminem Show left off but I know
Anything's possible though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder, I'm like O-J
He's like my Cochran today
We keep them Mark Ferman tapes in a safe
Lock em away
Better watch what you say just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua Gosh
I wish I could of told you not to do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (burp)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it let's all have fun, let's mingle (burp)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (fart)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (fart)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh no
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Oh oh ah ah
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Poo poo ka ka

Eri-eri-Erick swallowed some generic
Sleeping pills, and woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned sixteen and used a fake I-D
To sneak in V-I-P to see are Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
With their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hicky-dickory dirk diggler look at me work wizardry
With these words, am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or (scratch sound) jerkin your chain
Twenty two jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk
Or wait a minute what am I saying?
Allow me to run it back and rewind it
Wait let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin your chain
Am I berserk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Working the dang cameras
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Porno's who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered Britney and Justin
Video tapes of em fuckin'
When they was just Musketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club and dusted em
And went straight to The Source with em
Cause they could have sworn someone said ni-
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it
You can hear the ga-uh
And then come ta
Find out it was Justin
Sayin' "I'm gon-na cum!"
And this was supposed to be

[Chorus]

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics
I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800 I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay and make up with Ray
Hey! So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big a big cock
Or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off
Fuck a fuck off

(Chorus)
You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you had
'Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
But you're all that I love
Aggressed, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
'Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
We were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
'Cause if you could've took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we could've had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
Lord please forgive for what I do
For I know not what I've done.

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Mama had a baby and its head popped off
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
(head popped off)
But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(getting dropped off)
(getting dropped off)
(getting dropped off)
(getting dropped off)
Ring, ring, ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch
(Their front porch)
(Their front porch)
(Their front porch)
(Their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(Else's lawn)
(Else's lawn)
(Else's lawn)
Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles
(Edna and Charles)
(Edna and Charles)
(Edna and Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song
(Sing this song)
(Sing this song)
(Sing this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand
And by the way where's my dad?!

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?
Where does that leave me?
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream
While I'm projectile vomiting.
What do I look like a Comedian to you?
Do you think that I?m kidding?
What do I look like some kinda idiot?
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had,
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it man
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it,
Shit if you only knew the half of it?

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons I never
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Ooh!
Last one baby
Lets Go

(Good night)
Good bye

Your walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin'
And your in a nightmare
It's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waitin' for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's on a ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin' in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a colata pin
While I'm noddin'
In and out on the autumn and
If the Ramada Inn
Holdin' onto the pill bottle then
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at Mcdonald's
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
Shit
Guess I must of just blacked out again
Not again

[Chorus]
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin'
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin'
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin'
Grab my flannel and my bandana' then
Kiss the naked manequin' man again
You can see him standin' in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin' hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and not so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very mythological
When I slaughtered them

[Chorus]

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint fifth of Jack
My last Vic and a half
A flashlight
Up Kim Kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered the family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cousin
And I wrapped him
In Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink his bat water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood coverin' screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's three am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up(up)

[Chorus]

yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
yo (yo)
A yo (a yo)
yo (yo)
A yo ( a yo)
Shady! 
Aftermath
Ha ha, g-g-g-g, G-Unit!
Ha ha! (Ha ha)

[Chorus]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

[Chorus]

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

[Chorus]

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

[Chorus]

Yeah! Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that "Detox" album, it's comin'
We goin' make Dre do it (ha ha)
50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin'
Let's go!  Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin' out
Peace!

Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me!

Bye bye!
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick, ha ha!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Just it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed will hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that will blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgiv me"
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the president get a face lift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flier?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My D-J's in a coma for
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Ah-yo flashback, two feats, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'  nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, asap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

Stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a "Luni"
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin' "Kuniva yo yo"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from U-P-S for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!)
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

Ha ha, suck my motherfuckin' dick
D-12, Dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry
Ha ha, and Slim Shady
[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f*** it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some b**** who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground s*** that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the s*** you did with Rawkus too, that s*** was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus]

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's f***ed up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
Four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty s***ty man, you're like his f***in' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a s***ty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got s*** else so that s*** helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans",
This will be the last package I ever send your a**
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, 
Shut up b****!  I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh s***, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this s*** out?

[Chorus]

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that s*** intentionally just to diss you
But what's this s*** you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that s*** just clownin' dog,
Come on, how f***ed up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your a** from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this s*** about us meant to be together?
That type of s*** will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy s***
I seen this one s*** on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!
Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna f***in' sing
Cause I'm happy

Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit (sit), starin' out the window(dow)
Watchin' this world pa** me by
Sometimes I think (think) there's nothin' to live for (for)
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl (girl) (Hailie laughs) keeps gettin' older (der)
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes (jokes), 'cuz they don't understand me (me)
They just don't see my real side

I act like s*** don't phaze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no)

[Chorus]

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom did adum

Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cause there's a lot of s*** I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul

And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'

Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted

So here's what I'm facin', three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?

Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was f***in'
But f*** it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya

Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted

And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you (kiss)
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been last few years
Shit I don't know
But I do know I'm back now (haha)

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Dre I'm down here
Under the ground,
Pick me up broken tibias,
Fibias, yea fix me up
Sixty sluts all of them
Dieing from asphyxia
After they sip piss
Through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, box of oxypads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job and I'm back with a black stockin' cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
You can't say that yes he can
I just did faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next of kin
Tell 'em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy Ann and Andy
No, raggedy Andy and Andy
No it can't be, it can't be
Yes it can be
The fucking Antichrist is back, Danny
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville,
Calamity goddamn it insanity pills
Fanny pack filled with Xanax
Through every nook and cranny
Looking for trannies
Milk and cookies
Spilt on my silk negligee, lookie
Razor blades with me
To make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on the table with weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Till it jumps out the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Six semen samples
Seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot for Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And gladbags yeah, glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn what he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in brighton, I ain't enlightened
Biting into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a viking
Oh lightening is striking, might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck jason it's friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kinda shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian, shouldn't of had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming
To spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of funions
Mad at me, understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
out of a cannon and have him catapult, add an adult
Captain of a cult, with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Michael Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers, replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a forty, stuck a suppository up his ass
And made him tell me a story, gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetables section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krugar, and Edward Scissorhands too
Then came out with a little scratch, oh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight, with a triple back goose
Insanity? Can't it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off, and that's where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take
I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age, "But what about Jermaine?
"Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move
'Til I'm provoked, when I see you, I'm a step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools
Over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up 
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'm a only sting when I cornered
And I'm a only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck
White-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill
Or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us?
Come on

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day
But I handled my business
'Cause it's work before play, don't look for trouble
But I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up
I'm a fuck up your day, bullet with your name
Sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you'll die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone 
And I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest
And invest in something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'm a die a sudden death
Five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe, to collect a fuckin' check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus]

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was "The Chronic" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting fo
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
[Busta Rhymes]

Yeah, Guess who it is
Ayo Dre I think they in trouble
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em
Feels like a new day, listen

[Busta Rhymes]

Now every time I come in I hit ya niggas with shit regardless
You get retarted,then you niggas ain't got a clue.
On how the fuck I do what I do, and say what I say,
And spit what I spit, you ain't never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that could ever convince
My villi turn the place into a mutha fuckin' zoo
Than I come in I spit cr crazy sh sh sh shit and
Ma ma ma makin ni ni ni niggas do exactly what I want'em to
From my point of view instead of tryin to step up
You still tryin to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and fret and get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out and I doubt they could ever test my crew
Take a second check it I reckon my records are
Better than whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through.
You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it I'm one of
The greatest ever period every syllable is true

[Chorus - Busta Rhymes]

Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think its simple and I think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas could never ever really fuck wit me.
Cause ill hurt you .. and I will learn you a thing or two
And ill hurt you.....and ill finish your career for you.....I'll

[Eminem]

Shit on the mic and doodle my doo doo
You do not have a fighting chance to move you are covered in my poo poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid
Dou dou dou dou dou dou ga ga ga goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have it watch
So you just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Excuse my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
You're probably wonderin why there's thunder and everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause busa bus and flipmode just tiptoed into the club
Then with shady quietly try not to start a riot with Doc
But since we already started we might as well have a party
So gather out everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in your closet, throw somethin on and get to the club

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]

Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of
Bumblin fools who got me rumblin dudes all the way down the block.
Keep'em stumblin and jumblin over they words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin outta time sick and tired of all your
Ma ma mumblin ma ma mublin na na nigga I got it locked.
Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and
Turn up the volume you bang your head with courtesy of knock I
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga wit the glock
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin while I got you
Ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock
Before I start to do another thing that'll make you crown me
The king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling
While I'm climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get off my yot

[Chorus]
OK
Guess who's back 
Back again
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap 
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah 
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise 
I done touched on everything, but little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal 
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good god, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide 
Up the center of the dance floor 
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound) 
Oops my C-D just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl 
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Chance to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy 
Get the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...yeah 
Now what's your name girl 
What's your sign 
Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah 
Beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind
Now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl 
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it boy
We got you on tape 
Telling an old lady to "touch my body" 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
Now step back to reality 
Look it's B.Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man 
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah? 
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what? 
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls 
Fat girls 
Tall girls
Small girls 
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah 
It's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl 
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby

Oh baby baby aah aah 

Mm touch my body 
Mm touch my body 
Ooh boy just touch my body 
I mean girl just touch my body
Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! 
Please, stop! Fuck! Stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking On-Star isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home
God, I've been standing out here for like an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much
Really, you're a life-saver
What are you doing?
Fucking get away from me
What the fuck?
Fuckin asshole
Get away from me, you motherfucker
Get away
Get away you fuckin' freak
Get away from me
God damn it, fuck
Help me!
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

(Kuniva, you hurt?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with they car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Man! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'mma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet aways the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

It's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight

I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh

We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax

Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it

Baby all I want to do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Ah-yo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters

I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for thisresolution

You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back

Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it

'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
Til the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Til the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony

So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is

Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically

So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Til the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't want to fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Til the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Yeah, you got me
Im up now, its your loss
Must suck to be you

History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself
And what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
Never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

There must've been a gust of wind
Cause you change your mind everytime it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfucking-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you
Fucking men, you say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is going down
You must have just not have been truthful from the start
See, for me itd be nothing
To say you never had my heart, but Id be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a "relationship"
Ships sink, and you know it's love
As soon as you fall in it, cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by, and we only spoke twice
Im sitting in your driveway, calling you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say youre not at home
Im calling your cell phone
You answer, but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know? It should've been time to go
A long time ago; I kept holding on
It's comical when I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwing
I wasn't catching your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowing over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shitting all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're going to
Im haunting you, bitch!
Everywhere you turn I'm following you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me
You know it's true, it's killing you now
Yeah, I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's cause of you now I dont trust em at all
Fuck 'em! Middle finger up
Im gon' just keep grabbing my balls, cup 'em
Ill never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back
Knocking on my door all dolled up

Cause Im moving on, dont worry about me
Cause Im gon' be just fine without you, youll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now Id much rather be
Cause, goddamn it, Im glad that Im me
I said if you could be where Im at (bye bye)
Youd wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont, cause you just feel like you

Ive had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Youre options are leave or put out; granted your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what youre in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately Im feeling smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinking about who's loving me
Im thinking about who doesnt
Doesnt really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splitting
You dont think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you!
Aint no secret, no apologies, you keep it
Now that Im doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times youve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
Its my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought Id break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you
A million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money hungry hopeless ho
You fucking with my focus, so
Go back to that chump that played the role before
Love is like a cancer when you dont let go; Ima blow fo sho
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I dont need you sinking us, hope you float
Lying through my teeth, I hope you dont (Drown! Drown!)
Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show, let them show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, Im laughing, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothing is what we are
No beginning, no tomorrow

Cause Im moving on, dont worry about me
Cause Im gon' be just fine without you, youll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now Id much rather be
Cause, goddamn it, Im glad that Im me
I said if you could be where Im at (bye bye)
Youd wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont, cause you just feel like you
"Obie Trice. 
Real name no gimmicks?" 

Two trailer park girls go round the outside, 
Round the outside, round the outside.

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, 
Guess who's back, guess who's back? 

I created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to 
See Marshall no more they want Shady 
I'm chopped liver 
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya 

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor 
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker 
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital 
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating 

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating "Hey" 
You waited this long to stop debating 
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney 

But your husband's heart problem is complicated 
So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see 
They tried to shut me down on MTV 

But it feels so empty without me 
So come on and dip, bum on your lips 
Fuck that, cum on your lips, plus some on your tits 
And get ready 'cause this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis 
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch" 

A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel 
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass 

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe 
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me 
Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae 
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter 

Into the front of your skin like a splinter 
The center of attention back for the winter 
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing "Attention Please" 
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me 
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free 
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, 
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald headed say blow me 
You don't know me, you're too old 
Let it go its over, nobody listens to techno 

Now lets go, just give me the signal 
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults 
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil 
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to dis-cuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy 
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly 
And use it to get myself wealthy 

"Hey" there's a concept that works 
20 million other white rappers emerge 
But no matter how many fish in the sea 
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica.
Wait a minute.
You hold it right there.
Me and that woman love each other.
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together.
I met her on the beach

Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger.
That's not what I want to do.
I love her!
And we're gonna be together, never
Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die

Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life
Whatever 
Dre just let it run 
Ah-yo turn the beat up a little bit 
Ah-yo  this song is for anyone 
Fuck it just shut up and listen 

Ah-yo 
I sit back with this pack of zigzags 
And this bag of this weed 
It gives me the shit needed to be 

The most meanest MC on this   on this earth 
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self 

To relieve all this tension dispensing me 
Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently 
Off my chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 

When you freaks see me out in the streets when I'm eating or feedin' my daughter 
To not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuck anything 
I'm not Mr. NSYNC and I'm not what your friends think 

I'm not Mr. Friendly 
I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 

Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you - I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be 
It's just me 

[Chorus]
And I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant 
And "oh it's his lyrical content!" 
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses 

And all of this controversy circles me 
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em 
But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb 

It's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'Cause they full of shit too 
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school 

And they blame it on Marilyn - and the heroin
Where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at middle America 
Now it's a tragedy 

Now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

[Chorus]

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is" 

And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at Rock 'N' Roll stations 
And I just do not have the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 

Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to? 

What hood I grew up in? 
The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 

You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it 
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get 
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph 
You can call me an asshole 
I'm glad cause 

[Chorus]
Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper, Eminem
Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourettes
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a pricker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later
A teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance To make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room yeah but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling
Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
Cause I'd probably be Dahmer cause mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Now my mum goes womp womp womp
Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'
I'm bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
In terror they were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out
Whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smartaleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, til then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' Insert insult here
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock
Can't believe this little hick locked
This hip hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic and gridlock
Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock
Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
Cause I turn into the unabomber mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
(Mama could be wrong)
I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless
Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G Unit, haha

'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you

Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump. bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races

Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

(50 cent, come on)
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved
The sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return
Of the-the Doc and Shady, no one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

We came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Yeah, haha, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go, haha

Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin' out, peace
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me
Haha, bye bye
See you in hell, fuckers
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an eighteen-gauge
Left A-C right away

B-P is ninety over twelve
Respiration's at eight
Okay, I'm tubing him

D-M-C, this is medic forty-one

Medic forty-one, this is D-M-C base, go ahead

He's cold
Spike him back and grab the back board

Okay, got it
On three
One, two, three
Let's move
Love, love
Love, love,
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
Young Money yeah uh

Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost,
No love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
That's right (It don't hurt me) I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)
(And you don't hurt me)
That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you, (No more)
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em

I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
I'm a little bit sicker than most,
Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride,
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you, (No more)
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch you get no (Love)
Yo, mic check
Testing one, two, um, twelve 
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed 
In Curt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead 
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauren Hill's tape so her kids could starve 
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so 
S*** I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat 
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe 
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs until my show 
I just remembered that I'm absent minded 
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it 
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit 
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my s*** 
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness 
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis 
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list 
You want to get high, here b**** just sniff this 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again 
That's why I write songs where I die at the end 
'Cause I don't give a f***, like my middle finger was stuck 
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck" 
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd 
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now" 
F*** rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm Sorry 
I'm bored out of my gord 
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford 
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard 
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket 
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet 
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage 
And if you ever see a video for this s*** 
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got b****es on my jock out in East Detroit 
'Cause they think I'm a motherf***in' Beastie Boy 
So I told 'um I was Mike D,"they was like, "Gee, I don't know he might be." 
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert 
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out 
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'till I started bustin' 
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick 
Made a couple of crank calls collect 
I want to make songs all the fellas dog 
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of 

So just remember when I bomb your set 
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset 
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G 
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherf***er you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, f*** it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your a**
B****, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the f*** out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherf***in throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' s*** out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a f***in' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
F*** droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherf***in' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of b****es
Sick of naggin' bosses b****in' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Hey, f*** that!
Outsiders

[Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

[Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who want to die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't want to hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

[Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I "Square Dance" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - see'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit "Ether"
(Not) I shoulda crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. {*scratched* - "Watch your fuckin mouth"}

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
For the last time man, I'm through
Justin? It's Zoe.
Kelly did not have me call, however
I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life.

And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell him how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset and
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch.
Bitch fuck you
Goodbye.
My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom,
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oho whoa-ho,
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank
Fucking peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither,
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
And color a fuckin' zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
Ya little mother fucker,
I'll make ya sit there
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
Until next Thanksgiving'
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid.

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
My Valium, my Valium
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack?
You hungry you fucking brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
Take it and take a nap, eat it,
But I don't need it.
Then fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything,
But little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip,

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow,
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up,
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said save it boy, we got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls,
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah

Mm touch my body
Mm touch my body
Ooh boy just touch my body
I mean girl just touch my body
"Obie Trice. 
Real name no gimmicks?" 

Two trailer park girls go round the outside, 
Round the outside, round the outside.

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, 
Guess who's back, guess who's back? 

I created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to 
See Marshall no more they want Shady 
I'm chopped liver 
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya 

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor 
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker 
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital 
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating 

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating "Hey" 
You waited this long to stop debating 
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney 

But your husband's heart problem is complicated 
So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see 
They tried to shut me down on MTV 

But it feels so empty without me 
So come on and dip, bum on your lips 
Fuck that, cum on your lips, plus some on your tits 
And get ready 'cause this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis 
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch" 

A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel 
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass 

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe 
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me 
Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae 
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter 

Into the front of your skin like a splinter 
The center of attention back for the winter 
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing "Attention Please" 
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me 
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free 
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, 
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald headed say blow me 
You don't know me, you're too old 
Let it go its over, nobody listens to techno 

Now lets go, just give me the signal 
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults 
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil 
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to dis-cuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy 
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly 
And use it to get myself wealthy 

"Hey" there's a concept that works 
20 million other white rappers emerge 
But no matter how many fish in the sea 
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me
[50 Cent and Eminem]
Yeah... Shady
Haha (Wooo)
50 Cent... GgGgG G Unit
Haha (Here we go again)
Yeah Uh huh (Haha)

[50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause shady said so... I'm On Fire

[Eminem]
Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

[Chorus: x2]

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -
Industry niggas [unknown] you get out of hand
I'm gone find you whereabouts [unknown]
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand

I'm on the block where you was raised [unknown]
They see me poppin' more ice because I could [unknown]
You probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song

How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah Nigger
Shady Aftermath
G Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for

'Cause we move units
Uh Huh
And don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter fact keep em on 50
We call it even. Ha
Aw look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

(Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you?
Just leave me and love him out the blue
Oh, what's a matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You want to throw me out? that's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at Kim
Look at your husband now!

(No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! you're never going to get away at this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
(No!)
Sit up front
(Well I can't just leave 'ey alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back
Well I will you'll be in the trunk

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh God my brain is racing
(I love you!)
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
(No!)
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him didn't you?
(No!)
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me
Kim, Kim!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly don't you
(It's not that!)
No you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god I hate you
Oh my God I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

Come on get out
(I can't I'm scared)
I said get out bitch!
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)
Fuck you, you did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
Get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn't it?
(Yes!)
That was funny wasn't it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!
You can't run from me Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! ha! got you!
(Ah!)
Ha! go ahead yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah somebody help!
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you
Sometimes I just feel like
Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like

Dah, dah, dah. dah
It ain't my fault
Great then I fall
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Walking these train tracks
Tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm Eight Mile Road

I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr.Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew

This always happens, thirty minutes from home
Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden
''Shady, what up?''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my got damn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him ''Todd, you're the shit'' when does all of this crap end?
Can't park my ass without causing an accident
Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
But the antacid is my stomach gas
I mix my corn with my fucking mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upperclass
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)

They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
Her nylons ran, her skirt snag
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Fucking my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation
I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with welch's and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think there's more white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
God dammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the
Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)

Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed
Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries
He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me "wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet"
I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up in one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em stuck at the light
This fucking shit is taking forever to change
I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off
''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better'', fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery
Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivison to fuck with, bitch
Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you push me to my limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
Bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)
"Obie Trice. 
Real name no gimmicks?" 

Two trailer park girls go round the outside, 
Round the outside, round the outside.

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, 
Guess who's back, guess who's back? 

I created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to 
See Marshall no more they want Shady 
I'm chopped liver 
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya 

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor 
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker 
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital 
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating 

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating "Hey" 
You waited this long to stop debating 
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney 

But your husband's heart problem is complicated 
So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see 
They tried to shut me down on MTV 

But it feels so empty without me 
So come on and dip, bum on your lips 
Fuck that, cum on your lips, plus some on your tits 
And get ready 'cause this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis 
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch" 

A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel 
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass 

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe 
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me 
Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae 
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter 

Into the front of your skin like a splinter 
The center of attention back for the winter 
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing "Attention Please" 
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me 
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free 
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, 
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald headed say blow me 
You don't know me, you're too old 
Let it go its over, nobody listens to techno 

Now lets go, just give me the signal 
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults 
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil 
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to dis-cuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy 
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly 
And use it to get myself wealthy 

"Hey" there's a concept that works 
20 million other white rappers emerge 
But no matter how many fish in the sea 
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me 
So everybody just follow me 
'Cause we need a little controversy 
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the mother fuckin' kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste of sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama I'm a make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

I got some skeletons in my closet and
I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today!
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'd of killed them, shit I woulda shot Kim and him both
This my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never dis my own mama
Just to get recognition
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someones always goin' through her purse and shit missin'
Goin' through public housing system, victim of Munchhausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
Well guess what your gettin' older now and
It's cold when your lonely and Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that your phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x8]

[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'm a always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk

Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)

And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
Dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
Just you and I!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad

She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, want to ba-ba?

Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
Just you and I!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)

That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock

Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order

No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!

If you ever need anything, just ASK

Evil Deeds
-----------------------------

Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Chorus]
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
(elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles
(Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Chorus]

Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit,
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it

[Chorus]

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone

[Chorus x2]





Some days I just want to up and call it quits,
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all into all I spit,
Stead of always tryin to swallow it,instead of starin at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit, can't call it, shit,
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it,
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic,
I'm like a skillet, bubblin until it filter's up,
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up,
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts,
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
Well I'ma show you what, you gon feel my rush,
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch,
Bill the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yea, I'ma make your hair sit up,
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be,
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see,
What you closed minded fucks were too blind to see,
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee, Out this world,
Ain't no one out they mind as me,
You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine, all I need's a line,
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme,
To express how I'm really feelin at that time,
Yea sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,
Just sometimes, it's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest again,
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin,
Fuck I'm stumped, uh, wait, here comes somethin,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out,
New pad, krinkle it up and throw the shit out,
I'm fizzlin out, thought I figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I slave to this trade,
Cyanide, I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want,
I'm a switch-hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter,
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin boilin point,
Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed,
An M.C.'s worst dream, I make em jinxed,
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence,
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was comin,
By the screams of em you would swear I'm sawin someone,
By the way they're runnin you would swear the law was comin,
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothin,
Mama, Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest,
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'ma make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me, watch, I'ma win this race,
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch,
I found my nitch, you gon hear my voice
Till you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream til I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it,
Rabbit run!
Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

Outro: Eminem

Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, Restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb, which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out, killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, I'm out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Tonight's the night I get in some shit [Yeah] 
Deep cover on the incognito tip. 
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to 
Peelin' caps too cause you niggas know I'm comin' at you. 
I guess that's part of the game 
But I feel for the nigger who thinks he just gonna come and chance
Things 
With the swiftness so get it right with the quickness 
And let me handle my business yo. 
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop 
Until I get the nigger maxin' at the top. 
I hope you get his ass before he drops. 
Kingpin kickin' back while his workers sling his rocks. 
Coming up like a fat rat. 
Big money, big cars, big body guards on his back. 
So it's difficult to get him. 
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact 
With 
Him. 
Hit him like this and like that, 
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack 
What is this pen? so let's rush it. 
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it 
On the nigga's time, in the nigga's place, 
Take a strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face. 
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker, 
But I gives a fuck, cause I'm going deep cover. 
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop 
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop 
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood, 
Maniac, lunatic, call 'em Snoop Eastwood
Kickin' dust as I bust fuck peace 
And, the mothafuckin' drug police 
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop 
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop 
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do 
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue 
Dre, (whatup, Snoop) yo I got the feelin' 
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin' 
Killin', feelin', no remorse, yeah 
So lets go straight to the motherfuckin' source 
And see what we can find 
Crooked ass cops that be gettin niggaz a gang of times 
And now they want to make a deal with me 
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me 
And make my pockets bigger 
They want to meet with me tonight at 7:00, so whassup nigger? 
What you want to do? (What you want to do?) 
I got the gauge, a uzi and the mothafuckin' 22 
So if you want to blast, nigga we can buck 'em 
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!" 
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop 
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop 
Six fo' five was the time on the clock, 
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot. 
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up 
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up. 
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed. 
I'm checkin for the gats they strap, so what's up black? 
Chill, lets hit a deal, if it ain't up to what you feel then grab your 
Steel. 
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with? 
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip. 
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me? 
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey, 
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush, 
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us." 
Hmmm, let me think about it 
Turned my back and grabbed my gat and guess what I told him before I 
Shot 
It: 
'If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah, I'm lettin' my gat 
Pop' 
Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop 
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So it take it all
America! We love you! 
How many people are proud 
to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 
The stripes and the stars for the rights 
that men have died for to protect 
The women and men who have broke their necks 
for the freedom of speech 
The United States government has sworn to uphold. 
(Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) 
or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, 
So many motherf***in' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs, 
It's like a f***in' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed 
in no particular direction, 
Just sprays and sprays 
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, 
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought, 
standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, 
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear 
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? 
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office, 
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, 
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

[Chorus]
White America! 
I could be one of your kids,
white America!
little Eric looks just like this,
White America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get, 
white America!
I Could be one of your kids, 
white America!
little Eric looks just like this, 
white America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ya'self
If they were brown
Shady lose 
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so f*** school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the f***in' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a f*** I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like "F*** it"
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his a**
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this s*** wow
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?"

[Chorus]

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthaf***in' turbulance
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like 
"I dont like this, no!"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a b**** and say fagot
S***,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthaf***in' spokesman now for

[Chorus]

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
F*** you Ms. Cheney
F*** you tipper Gore
F*** you with the freeness of speech this 
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
F*** you!

Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? A joke? You smoking crack?
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground,
'For I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out,
Fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!

You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night

When the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N-W-A said fuck the police

Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Priscella at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
M-O-P had me grimey and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bow's
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops
Woo, damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw a Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite here to "Cheers"
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
And she caught me starin'
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of DeNiro (DeNiro)
The DJ's playin' Obie's song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't want to be headin' home
With some double D's full of silicon
Ten hood rat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin' "off to they rides!"

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally
Like a box of Cherrios
Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses petite, no window drapes

Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Ha ha, ha ha, ha
You gotta have teeth baby
It just wouldn't look right
Look, me big lips
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice, come on
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was "The Chronic" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded s***
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a f***

Zoning off one joint
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
Shopping the demo with gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
F*** a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
Live in the muck, never giving a f***
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the f*** down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you a**holes can kiss my a**
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a f*** y'all can kiss my a**!

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (S***tin' on rappers)
'Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you a**holes can kiss my a**
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a f*** y'all can kiss my a**!

I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh s***!)
Now how in the f*** am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the woman f*** b****es
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze strapping a mother f***ing bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the f*** I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
F*** I was born during a earthquake

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you a**holes can kiss my a**
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah f*** you to
To every time I reminisce
I miss my past
But I still don't give a f*** y'all can kiss my a**!
(feat. Dr. Dre, 50 Cent)

[50 Cent]
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha

[Chorus]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

[Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

[Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

[Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Eminem]
'cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
50 cent, come on!

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me [gun shots]
Haha, bye bye!
See you in hell, fuckers.
[Dr. Dre]
Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick
And I'm dancing

[RBX]
Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,
And I don't want to die
I don't want to DIE
I don't want to
I don't wanna die!

[Ice Cube]
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strychnine
Dumping on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers want to violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Dr. Dre]
Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order
Making there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallucination
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot Free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
Cause I can't wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
They call me dadda
6 million ways to murder
Choose one
Lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night
Hey!
Hey Em what's up?
Steve Berman what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again what's up?
Em could you come here and have a seat please?
Um yeah  what's?
Vanessa shut the door
Okay
So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
What?
This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record!
What?
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like
To be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But, I,
I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big-screen T-V's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin
I mean
I can't sell this shit!
What?
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What? I
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I supposed?
Now!
Alright man
Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again
Ken is back, tell some men
Rub my back, rub my back, rub my back, rub my back
Eh, wait, hello?
Eh, goodnight
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which should of been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody could of seen this shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me the minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standing and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground
So for now

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't want to look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I probably should 'cause these problems are piled all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cause I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell em

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

I don't want to quit
This shit, it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done ill never look at gats
If I scrap, I'm a scrap it like I never whooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamed I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never would of rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back
I just want to leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from being no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up M-Cin'
Its fucking crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good

So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
I never meant to...
Give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to...
Bring you to my world

And now you're lying
The corner cry-y-y-iiiiing
Yeah!
God damn
Feels like a long time don't it
You missed us
We missed you
Shady narcotics
It's the re-up
Pussies
And we're back
Myself
D-12
50 cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Cashis
From Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bullshit
Let's go
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet
Yo, mic check
Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Curt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauren Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm Sorry
I'm bored out of my gord
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'um I was Mike D,"they was like, "Gee, I don't know he might be."
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'till I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy

Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no)

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
So bad they should put his a** in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still cant tell em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Illest s*** you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
Whip out, whip down

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
Im sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
Im throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme Im spittin' while Im s***tin' on the competition
In the meantime its always mean time

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Ive been a career a**hole
I dont see why these people always got my back
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
And Im coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game

'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
S***.
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body

Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F*** you then
Blow it out your a**
Jumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman
Born with the endorphin's of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in
Self absorption
Skeletor, I went to hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus
Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back
His whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm desert storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible, hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible"
Expired tags on the Saturn
Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter, laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid...

You got it twisted
All 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic
Bitch get to massagin' this dick
Like spas in this bitch
Slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit like I've gone ballistic
With a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets
Trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to 'cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results
As Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage"
What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three inch blade on point like a Sensei
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex," throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned
And make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it
I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'till I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The board hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
'Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The rock cuts into rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelling quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face 'till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you
Man light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track

Why am I such a dick?
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouses moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts  brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, clich, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like
"Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*)
"Wait, dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah

Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Friday and it's my day
Chance to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl
What's your sign
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah
Beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind
Now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance

Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
Aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit
You signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah
It's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah

Um num num touch my body
Um num num touch my body
Ooh boy just touch my body
I mean girl just touch my body
Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Em, it's Paul
Listen, 
Joel just called me 
And he told me you're in the fuckin' back behind his studio, 
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range. 
I told you not to fuckin' bring your gun around, 
Like an idiot, outside of your home. 
You're gonna get yourself on trouble.
Don't bring your gun outside of your home 
You can't carry it on you. 
Leave your fuckin' gun at home.
Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, F it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some b**** who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that s*** was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

The tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all and even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's messed up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty plummy man, you're like his favorite idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got s*** else so that s*** helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S., we should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, not so bad

Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans",
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters,
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up b****! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shoot, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this tape out?

The tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that s*** intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how messed up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this junk about us meant to be together?
That type of crap will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one s*** on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you, damn!
Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin arses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That want to be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion 
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an

[Swifty]
?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit, 
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an

[Kuniva]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like 
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk 
I mean these niggas squeeze on me 
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!" 
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it 
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back 
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an

This is a public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady.
The views and events expressed here are totally fucked,
And are not necessarily the views of anyone.
However the events and suggestions that appear
On this album are not to be taken lightly.
Children should not partake in the listening of this album
With laces in their shoes.
Slim Shady is not responsible for your actions.
Upon purchasing this album you have agreed to not try this at home.
Anything else?
Yeah, don't do drugs.
And everyone should get along,
OK children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (he's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus]
See children, drugs are bad (c'mon) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, O-K? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper-drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull 
His back starts tah, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" 
Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus]
 
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'm a have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Come on children, clap along (shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!) 
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! (stern)fart(stern) Ew, ah!) 
(So, fucked up, right now)

'Cause it's your Goddamn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well shawty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
Settle ya fuckin' ass down I'm ready for combat-man
Get it calm Batman?
Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts

Girl forget remorse, I'm a hit you broads with
Chris's paws like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue motherfucker

Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their draws

Laying on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back
Bring me two extension chords
I'm a measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more
Fuck my dicks big bitch
Need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig

You can hold all the cards

Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping
Does a bird chirp, Lil' Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps
And smokes purp' does a word search gets circles wrapped around him like
You do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Sike I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Gotta pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
Whats the saying? Where there's thunder there's light-ening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the psychopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down
Oh no
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that, what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I want to kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it
Or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that
Then I'll kill you
You know why?

Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal
You god damn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That will stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or les'
Or the homo-sex, hermaph', or a trans'a'vest'
Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes"
Homophobic? nah, you're just hetero phobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em
Hey, it's me, versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it?  checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second l.p sends you directly to jail?
Come on! relax guy, I like gay men
Right, ken?  give me an amen (amen!)
Please lord, this boy needs jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch t.v, and comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each march
With a brand new c-d for these fuckin' retards
Duh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. "don't give a fuck," still won't leave

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal
An animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd want to fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went, when the president got oral
Sex in his oval office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blond-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy, who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim shady, I'm as crazy as em-
Inem and kim combined the maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor cause dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
(mm-mm-mm!) oh, that's dre with an a.k to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that will teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal
Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo 'em
What?
Don't kill nobody this time

Aw'right, god damn, fuck
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!

What?  oh my god, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Don't kill me, please don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'm a be a fuckin' rapist in a jason mask

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
Haha, swifty mcvay! 
Mr. porter, the kon artis (ha!)
I told you we wasn't leavin, c'mon! 

I come from a jungle, with a trunk load of punk hoes (nigga)
Muzzle this animal, fuck with mechanical
Gun totin hazardous cutthroat, cantaloupe can split it
And the pope couldn't prevent me from shittin on niggaz
Fitted caps get blew back like bad wind, imagine backspinnin'
Into a casket, it happens when bastards try to act masculine (hoe)
A hell raiser, I smack the skin off your man's face
So fast it'll leave acne on my hand when it land (hah!)
Placed in a class where professors came to school with smith 'n wessons
Just to teach us a lesson, had that ass hangin' up with the flag (yeah)
Parental discretion, I'll send you a video
With me naked havin a session on my urinal (respect it! Hah!)
When you kill in the nighttime and claimin' yo' innocence
I'll be waitin' ready to a. K. you and yo' egg bene-dick 
Usin' yo' balls to play tennis with (hah)
You'll be in some shit like flies and fuck the witnesses

(Motherfuck!) niggaz that doubt and thought we wasn't killin' shit
(What!) whatever you want, we providin' it diligently
(Pump!) double barrel wherever we go willingly
(Dumpin!) on opposition in the streets or industry

You was born I was hatched, but you came out deformed
I have nuts of a horse, and you ain't got no balls
Come runnin' with tec-9's whenever niggaz would call
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang, shoot up classway halls
I don't give a fuck, who you call to come
You came with thirty niggaz, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a nigga got in me
You gone off henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
Situations you in, don't get that "purple pills" shit confused
With us bein cool up here singin "my band"
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a fuckin autograph
So say that shit loud enough out of the fuckin crowd and
I'll show you the meanin' of die-hard fans
Saddam hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that mitchell and ness
So find your spinal cord, uh-uh-oh I digress
I guess I'm just too fresh, to finish that line
Denaun's ain't next
*Tuning Tv*
*Eminem Snortin' Coke

Tv Presenter:
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
*Door opens*
Who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Eminem:
Ha Ha!

Eminem & Hailie:
Ok then! Everybody, listen up!

Eminem:
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
(innocently) Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
I think my dad gone crazy!

There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailie Makes Chainsaw Sound*
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off

Dre:
Suck it Marshall!

Eminem:
Tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this muthafuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound*
Blow every fuckin' thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop, when will I knock the crap off
*Knocking*
Hailie, tell 'em baby

Hailie:
My dad's lost it

[Chorus]
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
There's nothin' you could do or say, that could ever change me
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom*
Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe Ronhe, n codeine n goddammit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
uh..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million muthafuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a muthafuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin' my flows, quit givin' me my ammo
Can't you see why I'm so mean? If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailie:
Dad!

[Chorus]

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
Aat the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
'Cuz when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightnin' twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screamin' at the sky, the clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the jist of it,
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Chorus]

Eminem:
Crazy
Hailie:
*laughs*
You're funny daddy!
Guess who? You miss me?
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus, Jessica Simpson

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a, rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who (chicka) made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin (Now come in girl)

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a, rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who (chicka) made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Excedrin
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit forget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a, rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

And that's why, my love, you'll never live without,
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate (Now break it down girl)

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a, rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

So baby, baby, get down, down, down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah
One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one "ouch"
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
(Check check check)
(Aight lets go)
(Lets go c'mon)
I'm gonna kill this bitch. 
I'm gonna kill her. 
I'm going to fuckin' jail, cause I'm gonna kill this bitch

Hey man

You've always got a bad feeling man. 
That's her car right there. Just park

Here we go again
Get down!
What the fuck do you want me to do get under the car
Yo, who's she walkin' with
How the fuck am I supposed to know? 
You told me to duck down
It's the fucking bouncer. 

Did she just kiss him?
I don't think so
Dog, she just fucking kissed him
No, she didn't
She's kissing him dog
No she's not
Oh shit
C'mon, Motherfucker!
(Don't kill me)

Thank you!

Go, go, go (what the, f***?)
What the f*** are you doing?
Mothaf***er bail on me? F*** you!

Aw, you gotta be f***ing kidding me
Are you f***ing kidding me?

The parking lot
S***, ah!
(Let me see your hands, prank's over)
F*** it!
O' Trice c'mon

Yeah, n****s got me, I'm a get 'em, it ain't ovah

You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice
And I'm poppin' a clip, 'bout to fix this issue
Ya pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you
Ya gonna need an ambulance to stitch ya tissue
Or either have a bag on ya hip to s*** through
Ya seen us on the Ave ain't just to get you
While my penis is a mag when I lift it hit you
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
Solemnly swear, on my daughters tears, the n**** that got 'em in the head
To fill it before the year ends, I hope ya inconspicuous my friend
Cause once the word get back you in a world of sin (Sin!)
Bullets will hurdle at him for tryin' ta murder whats, been determined
As the first solo African (Me!) It go platinum with an accident that
Happened with maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back my momma's
Blood pressure was affected from that my little girl needed a daddy
On the phone at a certain time exact now, and n****s act wild, when
The mac come out, ya n****s exiled (BLA-OW!) and I don't wanna hear
X - Y - Z, Im X'ing out your whole entity for tryin' ta kill me (Me n****!)
Filthy muthaf***as I'll show you a real B when he's H2B light up your
Kidneys I'm so sincere you're sayin' it hurts this year, its not a verse
It's a curse for birds and what's on your purse and over here this is Obie
Here I'm clear, n****s beware I'm coming at you with firearms and yeah (Yeah!)
Your purpose on superflowas how can I be merciful when merky needs
Mercenary school n**** I got paper I had your a** urgently exposed
No emergencies bring ya back ya souls, slugs shatter ya bones pat pat me
In the dome, learn this pattern we catch 'em at home, we wrong, that's when
Automatics sporadically catch 'em in the abdomen another dirty muthaf***as gone.

You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice
And I'm poppin' a clip, 'bout to fix this issue
Ya pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you
Ya gonna need an ambulance to stitch ya tissue
Or either have a bag on ya hip to s*** through
Ya seen us on the Ave ain't just to get you
While my penis is a mag when I lift it hit you
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
Call this mother fucker

Oh fuck yeah
Give em a piece of my mind,
A piece of my ass

(Thanks for waiting, this is, may I help you?)

Oh thank you
I need to make a collect call

(What number?)

Oh
The numbers 62,
(At the tone, please say your name.)

Kennith Kaniff, from Connecticut.
Automated piece of shit

Yo

Hey there cockboy.
Who's this?
This is Ken Kannif
Who?
Ken kannif from Connecticut, little bitch.
From Connecticut?
Yeah you wanna get a
I don't know nobody in Connecticut.
You wanna get a hotel room with me?
A hotel room?
Yeah, you want me to lick your ass, Eminem?
Ha, yo, wh, who is this? Cage?
Hey, pa ha
You want me to fuckin' melt in your mouth and not in your hand?
Melt in your ass, ya little cockboy.
(Laugh) yo shut up you little bitch.
Oh you think I'm lyin', huh?
Ha ha
I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An a**hole, that role I think I succeed fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked, sold three million

Then it all went blank, all I remember
Is feeling ridiculous 'cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could have stacked my s*** list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping s***, but since when did this many
People ever give a s*** but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid
Attaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out

Good luck trying to convince a blonde
That's like telling Gwen Stefan' she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down
In history think they know now
Because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, a**hole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, a**hole
Quit acting salty, I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth
When he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your a** socked in the mouth
Lay'em off it

But what the f*** is all this thrash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knock me down, I went down from the count
I fell but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the f***in pants off me
To take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Gotta go in that ring and knock them out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revolting

Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little s*** what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock
Just to go out watch Batman

Who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo

My soul's escaping through this a**hole that is gaping
A black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole
With a pack torn of paper
But I'm not taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the back pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
Trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack the girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin' we have some magnetic pull
Then scream' ICP in this b****, how the f*** do magnets work!?
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical s***'s gonna happen? That ain't practical

You crackin' a joke, it's laughable, 'cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
B**** you just need a helmet because if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina,
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor

Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog, 'cause you're on my a**
But you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherf***ing father time
And it ain't never gonna stop.

A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime,
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty gla** in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherf***ing coaster

I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah c***y, and can't not be, rude off
So fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird,
You stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're just an a**hole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
"Oh, everyone knows"
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an a**hole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think I think the lines are starting to get blurry

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face

I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based

Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, let's bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah Marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?"
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus

'Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you"
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic Kmart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker

And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
Adult with a childish like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like "merits, fuck that"
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish

And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition, ha ha

Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

This darkness comes in me (Evil twin)
Here it goes again (Evil twin)
If you chose my pen that ain't me it's my evil twin
He's just a friend who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me, blame him (Evil twin)
I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-written and destined to never leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her

Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it to beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver
Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean
My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em

They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "fuck the police" like cop porn

Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?

Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the looney police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me
Into a mental hospital with Britney

Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the chorus to fucking hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an a-hole
Eight and a base whether I'm fucking off that instead of your face, ho
Let your low hand raise, yo

Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work

But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skiddish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch
Shady, aftermath
BTOV

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Bobby Creek

I'm on the Patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the D-J playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wherevera
But I came here to get on goose and Tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin' everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place
The name is Snoop too
???
My drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your ?
Come tickle my gumdrops

I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Get yo ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Obie Trice!

One slug
Couldn't snuff young cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on these nuts
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
True that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock 'em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's Shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night pass to the matinee
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
And I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to you-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one

My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(Whats your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I dont know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha-ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

No! If he had, he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldnt be so mad, my attitude wouldnt be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm The epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, To be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, Im in the style department
With a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on, a
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea
Guilty, cause I sparked a, Revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
Cause its the

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I dont give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

So yeah dad let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of like
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle
Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads
The sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman
Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a criminal
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is
Dad, I'm back at it again
Bitch
I don't know why this world keep turning (Yes man)
Round and round
(As the world turns we all experience things in life)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
(Trials and tribulations that we all must go through)
I don't know why this world keep turning
(When someone wants to test us when someone tries our patience)
Round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
'cause we're dope as fuck and only get a two in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool, takin' a shit, in the warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin'
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who me?)
Yeah bitch you so big
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (rar!)
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

I don't know why this world keep turning (as the world turns)
Round and round
(These are the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
(These are the things we must go through day by day)

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya"
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinkin' ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
That's when her ass put it on me
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin' a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I want to kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ah! ah!)

Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin' dick!
Bitch, come here!

I don't know why this world keep turning
(And as we go along)
Round and round
(Throughout the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
(We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday)
I don't know why this world keep turning
(That we must go through)
Round and round
(These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I don't know why this world keep turning
(Every day every single day the world keeps turning)
Round and round
Yeah!
God damn
Feels like a long time don't it
You missed us
We missed you
Shady narcotics
It's the re-up
Pussies
And we're back
Myself
D-12
50 Cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Cashis
From Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bulls***
Let's go
This muthafucka man
It's ridiculous! I can't believe it! ! 
Hold on, em
What up? 
Have a seat? Dre, I'll call you back
What now? 
I don't even know where to start
Okay
I got the album from upstairs
And
And this is by far, the most,

Incredible thing, I've ever heard
Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight

I'm looking at you yeah girl you're kinda taken back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably think you'll get slapped so damn hard ya
Wont even be able stand up straight aren't ya?
A couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' you non-stop
I walk up on you, well hello Tonya!
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You outta gas, do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry basket in the back?
And sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day, no masks for this attack
I heard them say exact opposites attract
If that's fact it'll take task force to get you back

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four to six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
On nickelodeon flashed to little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look her she comes I'd better put out the big guns
"Hello Lindsay you're looking a little thin, hun'
How about a ride to rehab? get in cunt!
Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would have already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her with sixty six inches of extension chord

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts and skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs
But what was really going on was that I had developed a crush,
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant's tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight it's the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell, like "hello my love"
I just picked your prescription for ceriquill up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one ever since at schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little girl
You hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come on toots give me the Valium alley-oop, I'll slam dunk it in your mouth till you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm about to make a new outfit outta you
A new outfit? shit I'll make a new suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move baby, do how you do

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

Same kicking and screaming same crying and sobbing same song and dance
Same yelling and bleeding same begging and pleading same song and dance
[Eminem]
Big Proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you
We just wanna keep makin' you proud, heh

[Proof]
My life is trapped in these lines
That's why I'm packin' these nines
I got a rap I ain't dyin'
That's in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron
Can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers
'Til I'm snappin' my spine
Natural high, I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder
Proof get it poppin' like show'd a hold up

[Eminem]
We nothin' but soldiers!

[Proof]
Slow up!

[Eminem]
This gun is loaded!

[Proof]
Roll up!

[Eminem]
They beef 'n we leavin' 'em coked up!

[Proof]
If Em say it I spray it
If he will it I kill it
We kilpatrick 'n ill it
Yo Detroit, know I can feel it
Will at this gun on my waist-line
At war we don't waste time
Blow up magic can't take a punch
And Fifty can take nine, BLAOW!
We got schoolcraft here at the Seven-eight and Dexter
I'm up 'n holla spendin' dollas ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes suh', ya texta' is b****
Bet'chya ya flinch when Proof shoot up they crew
And wet ya whole clique
There I go, thinkin' of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome it would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song
I got a million reasons off the top of my head
That I could think of
16 bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it I'm a start right here and just be brief
About to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her names gotta be Kim shit
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you boohoo

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up, yea
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke-head and I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you its not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me want to yack, yack
But what else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I want to do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
Dre (Em)
Yeah, definitely, definitely dope.
Definitely, K-Mart.
Yeah, yeah

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw the line any fences
If so to what extent if at
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed super-man
Man how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
But who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

'Cause
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand
Four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)
Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made"
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream,
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
Just the two of us

C'mon hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? she's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt, her was eatin'
Dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? we'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out (wa'!)
I told you it's okay hai hai, want to ba-ba?
Take a night-night? nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven bonnie and clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I!
Just the two of us

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a whittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear (ma-ma!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of three dummies
One, two, free, wee! (whoosh)
There goes mama, spwashin' in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

Hi! My name is (huh?)

Slim Shady

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi! My name is (what?)

My name is
Slim Shady

You should listen to this beat through my headphones

See y'all niggas
Hit the switches on that shit one time, huh
Let the top down

I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game
And I'm still strapped with the heat man
And we steppin' on a nigga feet man
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol
I only love her when the ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire

Uh, it's just different
I know it feels different

Uh, I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown

Two seventy five and I just might agree
Ex-D-boy, used to park my beamer
Now look at me, I can park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave new
I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a golden globe bitch!
I take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money, I've made more off crates
Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains, fuck boy, out my face
I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me
Stuntin' to the max like wavy
Oh shit!
Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Have the XL 80 bike
Loud motor, they be like, "Damn!" when I'm comin' through, rang
Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that, right?
I love this shit like my own daughter
Let's spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya
Young, this is just different
Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh

I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing

I smell something in the air that's making me (high)
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high

Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so
Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)
This is niether the time or the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
And which motel which lake they found her in,
And how they attacked the victim,
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
He can give her some, she can give him some
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind
Ya look

If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause your just dyeing to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' bout' Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition I mean right
Nope, Paul Wall is dope and so's Bubba
But, but, But....
But I don't compete wit nobody
I just go hard do the rope a dope ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like I'm asleep it's awesome!
I'm like a sleeping giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta no where and bite prey
And sink my teeth in and fill em' full a poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em'
And let em' know I just don't feel em'
And smack em' with the backward E the' Eminem emblem
I was taught if your gonna murder somebody you should face em'
Tell em' why look em' dead in the eye then waste em'
And the dark shall emerge from the firey depths of hell
And swallow the shallow the hallow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell there souls
For this rap game and it goes

123 check,check 123, check 123
That aint the hook now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me!
Everybody bores me they just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror glows lips and it whispers come nearer

Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes 
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

[Chorus: x2]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

[Chorus: x2]

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight hundred
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!

[Chorus: x2]

So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends
Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
Oh! Ha!
