Lyrics
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend
Four strong angels at her command to send
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend

I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again

She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure
Carved by an artist who's hand is demure
Got a mind like a saber
Razor sharp and sure

God how I hate myself for still wanting her

Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her
Nothing more but a heart still at war

She had four white stallions coming up around the bend
Four strong angels already sent
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
If anything it should have been a better thing,
From underneath you
Staring at the ceiling
It's another world of chocolate bars 
And baseball cards and it hides
Inside of all this tension that I'm feeling
But it's all inside of you
And it's all inside of you

Surprise, Surprise
I miss your hair, you miss my eyes 
And this solitude is my confidence eroding
So We slide inside of someone's mouth 
And someone's eyes until
There's a sound of something intimate exploding.
But it's all inside of you
It's all inside of you.

I wish that I'd had anesthetized and sterilized and then
I wouldn't have this evidence congealing
Surprise, surprise
Another pair of lips and eyes 
And that's the consequence from actually feeling.
But it's all inside of you
It's all inside of you
Got a message in my head
That the papers had all come
Richard Manuel is dead
And the daylight's coming on
I've been wandering through the dark
Now I'm standing on the lawn

[Chorus]
If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you

It was cold when I awoke
And the day was halfway done
Nearly spring in San Francisco
And I cannot feel the sun
You were sleeping next to me
But I knew you'd be gone

[Chorus]

Take some time before you go
To think of Mondays coming down
And the people that you knew
And the ones that aren't around
You've been fading day to day
I've been moving town to town

[Chorus]
Close the door on a short night
Lift the lid on the daylight
6:09 West Tennessee time
I buy all my days
At the same place where the girl sells her nights
To a god of ocean tides
 
All night long
Writing poems to California
Melodies of failure
And the people I have thrown away
Meanwhile somewhere west of Carolina
In a congregation of strangers
We are digging holes to China
Then we pray to our reflections
In the water when it rises
Headlights pin the highway down
Jesus spins the world around
I spend all my tomorrows coming down
Goodbye all my days
I know I said I never loved you
But I might just try again tonight
Truck stops and river gods
Gas stations of the cross
Following a ghost Following a ghost
I pray the water wash away the memories and the cost
Carry me south to the sea
Along with your memories of me
We are born in the water
I will return to thee
 
Coloured lights and birthday cakes
Candle wax on paper plates
Breathe the water        
Hush-a-bye
You can see through water
All the way up to the sky
 
Gods of water         Gods of rain
Cover up the sun again        
We are crossing at the Mississippi line
I tried all my days
To love you just the way you hoped I might
But I’m leaving here tonight
I can’t remember yesterday
I tried
If I said I could
I lied
My friend assures me "it's all or nothing"
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me: "For one time only make an exception"
I am not not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
With the status of my emotions "Oh", She says, "You're changing."

But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean

My friend assures me "It's all or nothing"
But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget
I am not worried
"If it's love", she said, "then were gonna have to think about the
consequences"
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
"These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days" she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
It seems like I should say "as long as this is love..."
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away
She disappears and
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing
Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I don't care
How many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To a tree with roots
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere
I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it
And Everybody says
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, no are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair!
I'm a Russian Jew American
Impersonating African Jamaican
What I wanna be's an Indian
I'm gonna be a cowboy in the end I guess
I guess I bought a gun cause it impresses
All the little girls I see
And then they all wanna sleep with me

Oh, where do we disappear?
Into the silence that surrounds us
and then drowns us in the end
Where all these people who impersonate our friends
Say, "Come again, come again, come again"

Into the dark Italian underground of disco lights and disco sound
And skinny girls who drink champagne
And take me on their knees again
Then pull me up and out the door
Past railway cars and tranny whores
And morning spreading out across the feathered thighs of angels

Oh, where do we disappear?
Into the silence that surrounds us
and then drowns us in the end
Where they try to push you out to keep you in
And say, "Come again, come again, come again"

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue
In 1493, came home across the deep blue sea
In 1494, he did it with the girl next door
In 1495, he barely made it out alive
In 1964, these sailors left me at the door
In 1970, some people got their hands on me
Now I'm the king of everything
And I'm the king of nothing
Now I'm the king of everything
I am the king of nothing

Oh, where do we disappear?
Into the silence that surrounds us
And then drowns us in the end
Where all these people who impersonate our friends
Say, "Come again, come again. come again"

Oh, where do we disappear?
Into the silence that surrounds us
And then drowns us in the end
Where they try to get you out to get you in
And all these people who impersonate our friends
Say, "Come again, come again, come again"
Somebody screamed and all of Jim Jeffries dreams
Explode against a black fist
He falls to the floor
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why
But he can’t go back there no more

Future sounds so crazy
We’ve all heard that song before
Tomorrow’s the name we change from yesterday to blame
When the train just don’t stop here anymore

I got starry-eyed on the coaster ride
Andy says “Man, I need a break from the world outside
These days my life just careens through a pinball machine
I could do so much better but I can’t get off the TILT”

There’s a photograph on the TV
Black and white and 
Andy says something to you 
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like 
She says “I forget myself sometimes too”

Out past the doorways where we are sleeping
The White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And now I’m not breaking
The train’s just shaking
And I’ve never made it here before
There’s a Wild Mouse spinning the girls around
Til they can’t take it anymore
I used to dream in the dark of Palisades Park
Up over the cliffs and down among the sparks
It’s a long life full of long nights
But it’s not what I was waiting for
Everybody’s seen the horses diving down the shore
It’s a miracle they don’t make them anymore

So…”Make up ladies”…Wake up baby

You walked into the bar like some Saturday star
Stud-straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves
You’re a downtown pride fully-amplified Clyde
Gin-tight and aging but well-preserved
Remember Andy standing outside your bedroom window
Saying “Come on, let’s drive across to the Palisades
Keep going til we hit Reno, Nevada”
Don’t see Andy all that much these days

Still there are pages in back of the Action stacks
Where the White Queens creep and the tomcats peep

And the train’s not braking
The track’s just shaking
And I never made it here before
There’s a Sky Rocket turning the world around
Til I can’t take it anymore
You can carry that spark from Palisades Park
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark
It’s a long life full of long nights
And it’s not what I was looking for
Everybody dreams of horses flying ‘round the shore
It’s a bad dream we’re not having anymore

Man, have you seen Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her around?
Hey man, have you seen my my my Andy?
Hey man, have you seen her?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen her?
You seen Andy around?

Dressed up in our pirate best
All leathers and feathers and pearls
Andy said “Look at me man!
I am cookin’
These hands could finger up this whole world!”

He says “Come outside
Climb out your bedroom window
Shimmy down the fire escape
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Andy says “I’m dressed up just like Edie
Changing all the time
These leopard spots to polka dots
And say goodbye”

Come outside
Maybe we could move to California
Just meet me at the subway
And say goodbye

Come outside
The cops all think we’re crazy
But if you stay, you’ll just get married 
To a girl who’ll never know you
And then say goodbye

Hey Man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the sun
I was high as a kite on Lovely & White
Man, you could lose anyone

Hey man, have you seen Andy
I don’t know where he’s gone
Real love outlives teenage lust
We could get wet and it keeps us warm

Love is like Angel Dust
Lovely sometimes changes us…sometimes not
Have you been aching to trust or just…?
Have you been waking yourself with lust…?
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?

It’s a long wait at a long light
Cars frozen in flight
All the traffic stops to stare

At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada
Wearing nothing but air
And a pair of grey paper wings 
Andy thinks “I got nothing to wear”

We got nothing new and…
We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…
Thought I might get a rocket ride
When I was a child but it was a lie
That I told myself when I needed something good
At seventeen, had a better dream.
Now I'm thirty-three and it isn't me
But I'd think of something better if I could

All my friends and lovers leave me behind
I'm still looking for a girl
One way or another
I'm just hoping to find a way
To put my feet out in the world
Caught some grief from a falling leaf
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground
Said I should have put her back there if I could
But everyone needs a better day
And I'm trying to find me a better way
To get from the things I do to the things I should

All my friends and lovers leave me alone
To try to have a little fun
One way or another I just wish I had known
To go out walking in the sun
And find out if you were the one

Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?
And did you wanna dance with me?
Did you wanna hum a little harder now?
Can you see her waiting there?
Can you see her? Because I'm almost there
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me? 
All you want is a beauty queen
Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine
All you want is a place to lay your head
You go to sleep dreaming how you would
Be a different kind if you thought you could
But you come awake the way you are instead 

All my friends and lovers shine like the sun
I just turn and walk away
One way or another
I'm not coming undone
I'm just waiting for the day

Got no place to go 
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico 
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin 
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in

We got airplane rides 
We got California drowning out the window side 
We've got big black cars 
And we got stories how we slept with all the 
Movie stars 

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drink my worries down the drain 
And fly away to somewhere new 

Hop on my choo-choo 
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit 
If you dress me up in pink and white 
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight

She's my angel 
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me 
Cause she liked to scream at me 
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drive this little girl insane 
And fly away to someone new 

Everybody's gone 
They left the television screaming that the radio's on 
Someone stole my shoes 
But there's a couple of bananas 
And a bottle of booze 

Oh well, happy new year's baby! 
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day 
Or we could simply pack our bags 
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Flush my worries down the drain 
And fly away to somewhere new 

Take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drive this little girl insane 
Fly away to someone new 
Fly away to someone new 
Fly away to someone new

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
Don't it always seem to go 
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Ooh, bop bop bop
Ooh, bop bop bop

They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot

Ooh, bop bop bop
Ooh, bop bop bop

Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples,
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Hey now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Why not?

Ooh, bop bop bop
Ooh, bop bop bop

Listen, late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took my girl away
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Well, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Why not?
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Hey hey hey
Paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Ooh, bop bop bop
Ooh, bop bop bop

I don't wanna give it
Why you wanna give it
Why you wanna giving it all away
Hey, hey, hey
Now you wanna give it
I should wanna give it
Now you wanna giving it all away

Hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Well I woke up in mid-afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most
I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast

Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame
If you've never stared off into the distance then your life is a shame
And though I'll never forget your face,
Sometimes I can't remember my name

Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything

Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head
And the Ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed

Hey Mrs. Potter don't go
I said hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep

So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem
Aw, but I'd sure like to find out
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen

Hey, Mrs. Potter, don't turn
Hey, Mrs. Potter, I burn for you
Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me

When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor
And orders another. well, I wonder what he did that for
That's when I know that I have to get out cause
I have been there before
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door. Yeah.
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars
We stand up in the Palace,
Like it's the last of the great pioneer town bars
Aw, we shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars
Well, you can see a million miles tonight
But you can't get very far
Aw, you can see a million miles tonight
But you can't get very far

Hey, Mrs. Potter, I won't touch and
Hey, Mrs. Potter, it's not much but
Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me
Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me
Hey, Mrs. Potter, won't you talk to me
Mary Jane says, it's all right
She's just around the corner from the main light
Any day now, it's all right
She's standing on the precipice of big time

And I know I'm a little uptight
I got to go before the sun shines
We're just a couple small people squeezing out a life
We need a little good time

It's not far from here
Mary comes and goes
Drifting through the scenery
Of shallow days below
Now that's everybody knows

You follow trains out of town
And they vanish somewhere under the horizon
Yeah well, I saw Mary Jane drag her shadow
Down the tracks, stare off in the distance

It's not far from here
Mary waves 'Hello'
Smiling though she's sinking
In the shallow days below

Oh no, I can't find a way out of here
Out on the road again
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane

I'm all alone again and
I like what she said but not what it means
She leaves me drowning
Through the shallow days down below

You know I heard a band
Playing waltzes in a grange hall
The sun is sinking lower
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself
And nobody really knows her

Any day now it's all right
She tells herself that this will be the last time
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders
What she'll do with all her free time

Not too far from here
Mary turns to go
Smiling while the waltz begins
Dancing down the road

Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Freedom
What are we supposed to think?
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me

I'm all alone again and
I like what she says but not what it means
She leaves me drowning
In the shallow days way down below

"I'm sorry", she said
"I know it's not the kind of thing you want"
I'm falling, falling down
"I'm sorry", she said
"I know I'm not the kind of girl you want"
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down
Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There's people around who tell you that they know
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row
But you know you don't have to, you can just say no
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round

I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted
But they'll get theirs and we will get ours if we can
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Years ago my heart was set to live, oh
And I've been trying hard against strong odds
It gets so hard at times like now to hold on
But I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God

And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
A picture of Amsterdam
Bare trees under glass
Framed in the afternoon light
Of a winter long past
When I was a raiser
To Dublin I'd roam
She was a bareback rider
Some miles from home
Come back to me
She's a carnival driver
Hung in the sky
Cutting through time like a memory
Strung on a wire
The color of anything
Fades in the air
But she is the film of a book of the story
Of the smell of her hair
Come back to me
When every thing's over
And every thing's clear
When everyone's older
And no one is here
I try to remember
A girl on a wire
Tumbling and diving above Stephen's Green
Like a kite on the air
Come back to me
This circus is falling down on its knees
The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar
I think it's time to put the top down

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
So she said what's the problem baby
What's the problem I don't know
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
Think about it every time
I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it

How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me want to turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
'Cause everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love

Well baby I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love

These lines of lightning
Mean we're never alone,
Never alone, no, no

Come on, Come on
Move a little closer
Come on, Come on
I want to hear you whisper
Come on, Come on
Settle down inside my love

Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once
Upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love (x7)

Accidentally

I'm In Love, I'm in Love,
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,
Accidentally [Repeat: x 7]

Come on, come on
Spin a little tighter
Come on, come on
And the world's a little brighter
Come on, come on
Just get yourself inside her

Love ...I'm in love
Blue morning Blue morning
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity, Kitten, doesn't have to mean you're on your own
Your can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk awhile, baby
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream

Are you happy where you're sleeping?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?
I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream

I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Three for girls and four for boys
Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told

There's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
When you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
Open up your eyes
You can see the flames
of your wasted life
You should be ashamed

You don't want to waste your life

I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
"I gotta rush away," she said,
"I been to Boston before.
And anyways
This change I been feeling
Doesn't make the rain fall"

No big differences these days
Just the same old walkaways
And someday
I'm gonna stay
But not today
Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Treading around in the gathered rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
Would you drop a line my way?

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Threading his toes through a bucket of rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
You're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new life over
In the middle of the night there's a young man
Rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister if you're going to walk on water, you know
You're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door
When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers 
And all other instruments of faith and sex and God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to feed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been crying, I've been thinking 
And I am the rain king 

I said mama, mama, mama 
Why am I so alone? 
I can't go outside, I'm scared, I might not make it home 
But I'm alive, but I'm sinking in 
If there's anyone home at your place 
Why don't you invite me in? 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been there before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been lying, I've been sinking 
And I am the rain king 

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun 
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends 
After all the dreaming I come home again 

When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying 
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been dying 
And I've been drinking and I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king, yeah
On certain Sundays in November
When the weather bothers me
I empty drawers of other summers
Where my shadows used to be
And she is standing by the water
As her smile begins to curl
In this or any other summer
She is something altogether different
Never just an ordinary girl

And in the evenings on Long Island
When the colors start to fade
She wears a silly yellow hat
That someone gave her when she stayed
I didn't think that she returned it
We left New York in a whirl
Time expands and then contracts
When you are spinning in the grip of someone
Who is not an ordinary girl

And when you sleep you find your mother in the night
But she stays just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
And when you wake the morning covers you with light
And it makes you feel alright
But it's just the same hard candy you're
remembering again

You send your lover off to China
And you wait for her to call
You put your girl up on a pedestal
Then you wait for her to fall
I put my summers back in a letter
And I hide it from the world
All the regrets you can't forget
Are somehow pressed upon a picture
In the face of such an ordinary girl

And when you sleep you find your mother in the night
But she fades just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
And when you wake 
The morning showers you with light
And it makes you feel alright
But it's just the same hard candy you're
remembering again
Gonna get back to basics
Guess I'll start it up again 
I'm fallin' from the ceiling 
You're falling from the sky now and then 

Maybe you were shot down in pieces
Maybe I slipped in between 
But we were gonna be the wildest people they ever hoped to see 
Just you and me 

So why'd you come home to this sleepless town 
It's a lifetime commitment
Recovering the satellites 
All anybody really wants to know is... 
When you gonna come down 

Your mother recognizes all you're desperate displays 
And she watches as her babies drift violently away 
'Til they see themselves in telescopes 
Do you see yourself in me? 
We're such crazy babies, little monkey 
We're so fucked up, you and me 

So why'd you come home to this faithless town 
Where we make a lifetime commitment 
To recovering the satellites 
And all anybody really wants to know is... 
When are you gonna come down 

She sees shooting stars and comet tails 
She's got heaven in her eyes 
She says I don't need to be an angel 
But I'm nothing if I'm not this high 

But we only stay in orbit 
For a moment of time 
And then you're everybody's satellite 
I wish that you were mine 

So why'd you come home to this angel town 
It's a lifetime decision
Recovering the satellites
Everybody really knows for sure... 
That you're gonna come down 
That you're gonna come down 

I can see why you think you belong to me,
I never tried to make you think,
Or let you see one thing for yourself,
And now you're off with someone else and I'm alone,
You see I thought I might keep you for my own.

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I do.

Don't you think the time is right for us to find,
That all the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time,
Can't you see which way we should turn together or alone,
I can never see what's right or what is wrong,
'Cause that take too long to see now.

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I do.

Come on now,
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I do.

Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way,
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray,
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or it's me,
But if it's one of us I'm sure we both will see, yeah,
Won't you look at me and tell me.

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I, longer if I do.

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you,
For a while maybe longer if I do.

I keep falling in and out of love with you,
Falling in and out of love with you,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I keep falling in and out of love with you.
Colored rubbers and a bedroom set
I wouldn't know it if it hit me
You take a little step and then it feels like love
I think I better get a little of it in me
Give me a kiss
I think it feels like love
Give me a kiss
I think it feels like sunshine
C'mon baby, light me up
I wanna look into your eyes until I go blind and...

[Chorus]
You think that you can do without me
I can't do anything at all
You think that you can do without me
But I don't believe in Sundays
And I don't believe in anything at all

Your mother make you in a parking lot
My mother made me out of flesh and wire
Try to remember what you might forget
I try to remember everything
Try to remember so you don't disappear
Try to remember so you don't fade away
Your mother made you out of smoke and rain
Your mother made you in a fire that's faded

[Chorus]

I wanna touch you for the things I'm losing
I wanna touch you for my self-respect
Give me a reason or I might stop breathing
Give me a reason why I'm soaking wet
Gotta stop breathing cause the sky is falling
I might go out and watch the moon explode
Give me directions to the highway crossing
I'll go lie down in the middle of the road

[Chorus]

I don't believe in Sundays
And I don't believe in anything at all
I don't believe in anything at all
Step out the front door like a ghost 
Into the fog where no one notices the 
Contrast of white on white. 
And in between the moon and you the angels 
Get a better view of the crumbling
Difference between wrong and right. 
I walk in the air, between the rain, 
Through myself and back again where? I 
Don't know 
Maria says she's dying, through the door 
I hear her crying why? I don't know 

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand 
She said she'd like to 
Meet a boy who looks like Elvis. 
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets 
The land just like she's 
Walking on a wire in the circus. 
She parks her car outside of my house 
And takes her clothes off, says she's 
Close to understanding Jesus. 
She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood, 
She has trouble acting
Normal when she's nervous. 

Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same 
Round here we talk just like lions, but we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands 

Oh sleeping children better run like the wind, 
Out of the lightning dream 
Mama's little baby better get herself in out of the lightning 

She says "it's only in my head." 
She says "shh, I know it's only in my head." 

But the girl on the car in the parking lot says
"man, you should try to take a 
Shot. can't you see my walls are crumblin'" 
Then she looks up at the building 
And says she's thinkin' of jumping. she says 
She's tired of life, she must be tired of something. 

Round here she's always on my mind 
Round here (hey man)i got lots of time 
Round here we're never sent to bed early and nobody makes us wait 
Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late. 

I can't see nothing, nothing round here (oh) 
Won't you catch me if I'm falling? 
Won't you catch me if I'm falling? 
Won't you catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you. 

See I'm under the gun round here 
Oh man I said I'm under the gun round here 
And I can't see nothing, nothing round here.
We used to say that come the day,
We'd all be making songs,
Or finding better words.
These ideas never lasted long,
The way is up along the road,
And the air is growing thin,
Too many friends who tried,
Blown off this mountain in the wind.

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
When my time is up, I'm gonna see all my friends.
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
If you really mean it, it all comes round again.

And now I see, I'm all alone,
But that's the only way to be.
Well you'll have your chance again,
Then you can do the work for me.

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
When my time is up, I'm gonna see, see all my friends.
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
If you really mean it, it all comes round again.

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
When my time is up, I'm gonna see all, see all my friends.
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
If you really mean it, it all comes, it all comes round

Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge,
When my time is up, I'm gonna see all, see all my friends.
Meet on the ledge, oh meet on the ledge,
If you really mean it, it all comes round again.
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til its gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot

They took all the trees
And put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half to seem 'em

No no no
Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got
Til its gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot

Hey farmer farmer
Put away the DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please!

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Til its gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
Hey, now they paved paradise
To put up a parking lot
Why not?

Listenin' late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi
Took my girl away
Now, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Til its gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot

Hey now, now
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got
Til its gone
They paved paradise
To put up a parking lot
Why not?
They paved paradise
To put up a parking lot
Hey hey hey
Paved paradise
To put up a parking lot

I don't want give it
Why you want give,
Why you want give it all away?
Hey hey hey
Now you want give it,
Ah she want to give it
Cause she givin' it all away
Now now now

I don't want give it
Why you want give,
Why you want give it all away?
Giving it all, giving it all away

Why you want it?
Why do you want it? (She's giving it all away)

Hey pave paradise
Put up a parking lot
Colorado passes by like writing on a wall
Headed Eastward down to New Orleans
Dipping into Texas as the stars are fading out
But there’s still a lot of country in-between
When I left California, I was 29 years old
And the world just spun me ‘round
Now I just watch Louisiana
Scroll across the windowpane
And I face in the direction I am bound
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Make the waters come and wash me away
 
Me, Clifton and the King of Cats sat down in the road
Pedro said “Boys, we’re three of a kind”
He said “I’ve sat with river rats
And I’ve hung my hat with diplomats
I had 4 brothers once upon a time”
He said they toured the country far away from the Rio Grande
But the road just wore them down
So they bought a house beside a lake outside of New Orleans
And they stared in the direction of the escalating sound
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Take this good man’s son and wash him away
 
Sister Indecipherable is talking to a wall
Back in New York City, she’s a queen
Resurrect or genuflect
She saves the ones she can’t protect
And keeps the chapel pris- (if not Sis-) tine
She drinks Absinthe mixed with kerosene
To keep herself upright
But the world still brings her down
If you can’t keep your shit together when God is on your side
What chance do you have when he’s not around?
 
Cover up the sun
Make that water run
Let the river come to wash me away
 
People of the Mardi Gras in their Tuesday best
Waiting for the South to rise again
Children of Geronimo grieving for The West
Feather-dressed and marching the refrain
In the dark of Armstrong Park
The marching bands attend
But they never make a sound
Just a quiet prayer for Congo Square
A silent conversation there
With the night to rest our eyes in
We just look to the horizon for a change
Cover up the sun
Let the river run
Pray the waters come to wash me away
 
Color in the sky
Make the diesel fly
Lay me down to die and take me away
Take a message to your head
Just stay beside her in the bed
You were so stupid
To believe in things you couldn't see
Then make them all you want

If you haven't got the reasons
Just make up any reasons
Then pick them 'til they're torn

Take it all away
You took your coat today
But they all go back in the morning

Make a time to find your way
I got a little further today
Wash your eyes clear of anything
Make them empty circles
Dress yourself in black or Grey
I'm hungry like a wild waif or only child
This lithium is heroin to me

It makes it all withdraw
All the anger and loss
But it all keeps coming back in the morning

You keep yourself too clean
You dig yourself a dream
That we won't be coming home alone

Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
I was an alien in utero
Somehow missed New Mexico
Fell to Earth in Baltimore
I know

Now there are layer cakes in empty rooms
Birthday cards and red balloons
And me
I know I know 
I know I know

I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie O
Empty parties filled with people I don’t know

I am written in the radio 
I dream on my TV
Dislocation Dislocation
I am fading out in stereo
I don’t remember me
Dislocation Dislocation
Telling lies and taking shots
Getting laid in parking lots
Getting high and getting caught
I know

All my broken paper planes
Parachutes and windowpanes
I’m a shooting star gone Novocain
I know

So I write to all the girlie magazines
Splash my passion on the pages in-between

I am written in the radio 
I dream on my TV
Dislocation Dislocation
I am fading out in stereo
I don’t remember me
Dislocation Dislocation
Rising from the afterglow
A dodo bird with polio
And me
I know I know I know I know

I’m playing with a rock’n’roll band on the subway
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays
We live between the BOOM BOOM CRASH
And the fadeaway
I know

Wake up the congregation!
We will see the light tonight!
The spark! The flash! 
The bang! The bite!
I know I know 
I know I know 
I know 

I am written in the radio 
I dream on my TV
Dislocation Dislocation
I could fade away in stereo
You won’t remember me
Dislocation Dislocation

If they drop the bomb on London
Swallow LA with the sea
Dislocation Dislocation
Say a prayer for Oklahoma
Say another one for me
Dislocation Dislocation
I guess I think I feel alright 
You come circling through the light
The skyline is bright tonight
What more perfect rendezvous? 
The sundown paints the shadows through 
The daylight, Amy, on what we do
 
It looks like darkness to me 
Drifting down into Miami 

Can I say
I wish that this weather would never leave?  
It just gets hard to believe 
That god sent this angel to watch over me 
Cause my angel 
She don't receive my calls 
Says I'm to dumb to
To dumb to fight 
To dumb to save 
Well, maybe I don't need no angel at all 

It looks like darkness to me
Drifting down into Miami 
She could pull the sunlight through me
Coming down into Miami

Make a circle in the sand 
Make a halo with your hands 
I'll make a place for you to land 

The bus is running
It's time to leave 
The summer's gone
And so are we 
So come on baby, 
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Blue morning, blue morning
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity, kitten
Doesn't have to mean you're on your own

You can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk a while, baby
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream

Well, are you happy where you're sleepin'?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?

Well I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone

All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream

Well, I dreamt I saw you walking
Up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky
As you stood there counting crows

One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for girls and four for boys
Five for silver, six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told

But there's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
Yeah, when you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in

All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Open up your eyes, you can see the flames, flames, flames
Of your wasted life, you should be ashamed

Yeah, you don't want to waste your life, baby
You don't wanna waste your life, now darlin'
You don't wanna waste your life, baby
You don't wanna waste your life, now darlin'

Oh, you don't wanna waste your life, now babe
I said, "You don't wanna waste your life, now darlin'"
Oh, you don't wanna waste your life, now baby
Oh, you don't wanna, you don't wanna waste your life, now darlin'

Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change

I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
I said, "I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me"

I said, "I will walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me"
I said, "I will walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight"

Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Oh change, change, yeah

Oh, change, change, change
Oh, change, change, change
Change, change, change change
Change, change, change, change, change
All I want is something good
It gets harder every time
She is leaving here tonight
Take a breath
Take your time
Spread your wings and rise

Make a mark upon the wall
Paint your face and pass the time
Close your eyes and she ascends
Hold your breath and ease your mind
Forty Thousand times
Time fades into the night

They descend and then they climb
Feathers falling through the night
Have you seen Ohio rise?
It has been four days and nights

All I want is something fine
It gets harder every time
She is sleeping far away
Take a breath
Take your time
Spread your wings and rise
Rise into the black Ohio skies

Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I don't care
How many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To a tree with roots
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere
I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it
And Everybody says
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, no are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair!
Anythings hard to change
But hey I got you down on your knees again
You watch the sky
It's a pale parade of passing clouds
That cover
The bed upon which we laid
In the dark
And the memories that I made
Of a laughing girl
But you're just my toy
And I can't stop playing with you, baby

[Chorus]
If you think you need to go
If you wanted to be free
There's one thing you need to know
And that's that you can't count on me

Coming along real good
But I still can't do most of the things I should
I watch the sky coming down to bury me and
I can't stop this crawling out of my skin
I know that you see yourself flying in
Out of the sky
Coming down
To carry me
But I won't come out

[Chorus]

No you can't count on me

I watched all of the same parades
As they passed on the days that you wish you'd stayed
All this pain gets me high
And I get off and you know why

[Chorus: x2]

Aw you can't count on me
No you can't count on me
I took the cannonball down to the ocean
Across the desert from sea to shining sea
I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me

"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"

She buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from
She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness
Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go

"How do you do?"
She said, "How do you do?"

I took the cannonball down to the ocean
Watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves
Love is a ghost train howling on the radio
"Remember everything." she said, "when only memory remains."

"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"

A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California I think you should
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend
Four strong angels at her command to send
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend

I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again

She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure
Got a mind like a sabre
Razor sharp and sure

God how I hate myself for still wanting her

Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her
Nothing more but a heart still at war

She had four white stallions coming up around the bend
Four strong angels already sent
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend

She had four more seasons wrong, broken to mend
And I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again
Miller's angels in black and white
Welcome everyone in
Children dreaming of wrong and right
Wrapped in grace and in sin

They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky 
But you never know where they're gonna go
Hey Romeo
Miller's fingers are traveling down the length of her thigh
But Miller's mind is still wandering
Staring up at the sky

They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky
But you never know where they're gonna go
Hey Romeo

Don't come around here

Miller's angels are hovering in between the earth and the sun
In the shadow of God's unwavering love 
I am a fortunate son

They come out of the blue sky
They come out of the blue
They come out of the blue sky
But you never know where they're gonna go
Hey Romeo

I was wasted in the afternoon waiting on a train
I woke up in pieces and Elisabeth had disappeared again
I wish you were inside of me
I hope that you're ok
I hope you're resting quietly
I just wanted to say

Goodnight Elisabeth

We couldn't all be cowboys
So some of us are clowns
And some of us are dancers on the midway
We roam from town to town
I hope that everybody can find a little flame
Me, I say my prayers,
Then I just light myself on fire
And I walk out on the wire once again
And I say

Goodnight Elisabeth

I will wait for you in Baton Rouge
I'll miss you down in New Orleans
I'll wait for you while she slips in something comfortable
And I'll miss you when I'm slipping in between
If you wrap yourself in daffodils
I will wrap myself in pain
And if you're the queen of California
Baby I am the king of the rain
And I say

Goodnight Elisabeth

If I could make it rain today
And wash away this sunny day down to the gutter
I would just to get a change of pace
Things are getting worse, but I feel a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me

Well, Amy hit the atmosphere
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter
And she's never coming back I fear
Anytime it rains she just feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me

We've waited so long
For someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
Meanwhile all the days go drifting away
And some of us sink like a stone
Waiting for mothers to come

There has to be a change I'm sure
Today was just a day fading into another
And that can't be what a life is for
And anything she said well she feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me

We've waited so long
For someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
Meanwhile all the days go drifting away
And some of us sink like a stone
Waiting for mothers to come

I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know,
I want to know, I want to know
And all I really know is I want to know
And all I really know is I don't want to know
And all I really know is I want to know
And all I really know is I don't want to know [last two lines repeat]
Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.
I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house
Takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands
Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
She says It's only in my head
She says I know it's only in my head
But the girl in car in the parking lot

Says "Man you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?"
Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something
Round here she's always on my mind
Round here hey man got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late
Got no place to go 
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico 
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin 
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in

We got airplane rides 
We got California drowning out the window side 
We've got big black cars 
And we got stories how we slept with all the 
Movie stars 

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drink my worries down the drain 
And fly away to somewhere new 

Hop on my choo-choo 
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit 
If you dress me up in pink and white 
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight

She's my angel 
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me 
Cause she liked to scream at me 
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drive this little girl insane 
And fly away to someone new 

Everybody's gone 
They left the television screaming that the radio's on 
Someone stole my shoes 
But there's a couple of bananas 
And a bottle of booze 

Oh well, happy new year's baby! 
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day 
Or we could simply pack our bags 
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Flush my worries down the drain 
And fly away to somewhere new 

Take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me 
Drive this little girl insane 
Fly away to someone new 
Fly away to someone new 
Fly away to someone new
Staring out of his window as the world rushes by
Arthur Robinson closes the glass and replies,
"I dream of Ballerinas and I don't know why 
but I see Cadillac's sailing


I was born on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today
So I am endlessly waiting

And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.

Carrie's down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins
From where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again


And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.

I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side
In a house where regret is a carousel ride
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now...


There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell
There's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well'
I may not go to heaven
I hope you go to hell

And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.
I sold my piano
It couldn't come with me
I locked up my bedroom
And I walked out into the air
When nothing I needed
Is left there behind me
I walk out through the shadows
Of Washington Square

Now I wander the highway from Dublin to Berkeley
And I heard the songbirds of Valley Paurine
I love like a fountain
And it left me like nothing
Just the memories of walking through Washington Square

Now I live in the shadows
Where light is electric
And time is just a number
That rests on a wall
Nobody knows me
My friends and my family
Are as far from this city
As Washington Square

So cover this warm night
In a blanket of starlight
I will follow this freeway
Out into the air
In case you should wonder
And wanted to find me
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square
In case you should wonder
I'm in Washington Square
Washington Square
Washington Square
I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning 
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray 
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Grey is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you.
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me."
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe 
in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we star at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me."
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how 
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
What's there that makes you want to be lonely?
What's there to keep you sitting at home?
He'd always say no, no, no
As if he wanted you to be hungry

Well, the same things you're missing
Could get you into something else
Better leave when to stay
Is only nothing but being alone

What I wanted you to know is kid things
Seemed like nothing at all
Kid things make it better than it was
Kid things seemed like nothing at all
But kid things make it better than it was

Hey, what you got that makes you want to be lonely?
Hey, what you got that makes it a better way to be?
She said no, no, no
I can't get any love and it's a Sunday

I said oh, yeah
What makes you think I wanted it that way?
'Cause one or two more smiles from you
And I don't need anything else

What I wanted you to know is kid things
Seemed like nothing at all
Kid things make it better than it was
We're just kids
We spend all night on the phone
It's a kid thing
But I sleep better when I'm not alone

What I want right now is just some more
Gimme more, hey what you think
Is you're not getting any younger
What I know is that you're not really very old

I know you wanna say no, no, no
It feels much better in the summer
Well, if it isn't warm where you're sittin'
Then kitten come on in out of the cold
'Cause all I know is when I'm with you
Well, I don't need anything else

What I wanted you to know is kid things
Seemed like nothing at all
And kid things make it better than it was
We're just kids
We spend all night on the phone
It's a kid thing
So I sleep better when I'm not alone

Kid things seemed like nothing at all
Kid things make it better than it was
We're just kids, just like driving a car
It's a kid thing and the further out
The closer in you are

(come on children, mind the gap)

Miracle people with marvelous hair
And a knack to do anything
Better than anyone
I got a home with electrical air
And I live in a world
Smaller than any one
I got a line a new frontier
I got a line on a new America
All of the people are vanishing here
I could be huge if I could just get from

The outside of everything
To the inside of you
From the outside of everything 
To the inside of you

Purest Aluminum people
Are walking the streets of London
So hysterical
Nobody here gets a word that I say
And the problems I'm told, 
Are more than medical
I got a friend from the new frontier
And Galen, she says, 
"this is not america" 
You need a girl with electrical hair
And the word that you wanted was al-you-mi-ni-um 

From the outside of everything
To the inside of you
From the outside of everything
To the inside

I was in bed with
The girl at the end of the world
She says I'm goin' home
And you should come home too
I'm at the end of a new frontier
Here at the edge of the flat earth ending
I'm getting off to get lost in the air
At the end of the world where the light is bending

From the outside of everything to the inside of you 
From the outside of everything to the inside of you
From the outside of everything to the inside of you
From the outside of everything to the inside of you
To the inside of you
To the inside of you
To the inside of you
To the inside of you
Got a message in my head
That the papers had all gone
Richard Manuel is dead
And the daylight's coming on
I've been wandering through the dark
Now I'm standing on the lawn

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Well it was cold when I woke
And the day was halfway done
Nearly spring in San Francisco
But I cannot feel the sun
You were sleeping next to me
But I knew that you'd be gone

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Take some time before you go
Think of Monday's coming down
And the people that you knew
The ones that aren't around
You've been fading day to day
I've been moving town to town

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Fading everything to black and blue 
You look a lot like you 
Shatter in the blink of an eye 
You keep sailing right on through
Every time you say you're learning 
You just look a lot like me 
Pale under the blistering sky 
White and red 
Black and blue 
You've been waiting a long time 
You've been waiting a long time 

To fall down on your knees 
Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
Fall asleep next to me 
Wait for everyone to go away 
And in a dimly lit
room where you've got nothing to hide 

Say your goodbyes 
Tell yourself we'll read
a note that says
I'm sorry everyone 
I'm tired of feeling nothing goodbye

Wash your face 
Dry your eyes 
Cause you've been waiting a long time 
You've been waiting a long long time 
To fall down on your knees 

Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
But fall asleep next to me 
Have a dream I'm falling down 

On my face 
Scrape my knees
Scrape my hands until they bleed
Cause you're fast asleep next to me 
Next to me, next to me, next to me
Dancing like the nights are down in nashville
But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run
I got a call to go to a late night picture show
So I traded in the darkness and I'm already there
I'm already there

[Chorus]
And I'm tryin' to make some friends
So if you see that movie star and me
If you see my picture in a magazine

Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV

Well honey I'm just tryin' to make some sense
Outta' me

I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco
And now you wanna say you see through me
But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me
So why you turn around tonight
But I'm already there
I'm already there

[Chorus]

Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV

Well honey I'm just trying to make some sense
Los Angeles
Boston gets cold this time of year
Seems like each day just leaves me numb
I gotta get out of here
Go walking in the sun

Well if you see that movie star and me
Or if you should see my picture in a magazine
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV

But honey I'm just trying to make some sense
Honey I'm just trying to make some friends
Well baby I'm not trying to make amends
For coming to Los Angeles
Oh Los Angeles

No more Boston, no more Nashville, no more Oakland
Oh baby come on out to the sea
Come on take a walk down Sunset with me

Oh we gonna get drunk, find up some skinny girls, and go street walking
In Los Angeles!

And man its a really good place to find yourself a taco
In the still water she lies down
Shaking through the press of sunlight
We rolled into Lexington
She shakes off the drop of daylight
Water beading up her chest
Bleeding down between her knees
Rivers in Kentucky flow
Between the bluegrass wavy seas
But oh, Margery
Twists the knife once more inside of me
Breathless with anticipation
Baited reelers set their hooks
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass
And lie and wait beside the brooks
We're infants pushing slowly through
Frustration leading back along
The alleys of a childhood
That will not release us willingly
But oh, Margery ..sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (strait into me baby)
Dust me off and shut me down
And dream of where I haven't been
Close the door inside my heart
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind
I have hollow eyes
Haunting only to myself
Even so, I can't stop calling
These great big hollows in myself
I took the train from California
To the far side of the continent
Woke up in Kentucky
Where a wedding was about to end
I looked up at Anna
She turned back to look at me
It's best to kill the ones that matter
Render blind the ones who see
But oh, Margery
Takes the blade and walks away from me
Oh, Margery
Love like blood is pouring out of me
Oh, Margery
My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby
Oh, I can't shut it in
It's got far too many doors to block the wind
Oh, I can't shut it in
Wasted time running scared, when all of love needs is to be believed in
All those springs come and gone,
Passed like trains and box cars, leaving
But I would be lying if I didn't tell you the truth
They will leave you, they will leave you

So come now, let's go dance to the siren's song
Come now, leave your damage behind and gone
Some are lost to you,

Wasted time running scared all I need is to believe in
Something like a summer and I know you need somebody just like I do
And all of these foxes go down in there barrel to hide
They will leave you, they will leave you behind

So come now, let's go dance to the siren's song
Come now, leave damage behind and gone
So come now, let's go down to the dance floor
Come now, lose your mind at Le Ballet Do'r
Some are lost, some are leaving, some are lost, some are leaving
But I'm not gone at all, I'm not going anywhere at all
Some are lost to you,
Wasted time running scared now autumns fire is ashes on the breeze
And it spends away like dust on pearls as winter comes to usher in the evening
All of these drummers go stand on the hillside alone
They will leave you, they will leave you at home

So come home now, lets go dance to the siren's song
Come now, leave your damage behind and gone
So come now, let's go down to eh dance floor
Come now, loose your mind at Le Ballet Do'r
So come now, Come now, let's get out while the getting's good
Just come now, there's no one left in the neighborhood
I don't know if you can hear me,
I'm feeling down and can't think clearly.
Even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.

Some things I'd change but it's too late,
I'd take the past and make it straight,
And even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.

Even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.

I'm sorry for the things I've said,
But some thoughts just won't leave my head,
And even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.

Even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.

Even though it's complicated,
We've got time to start again,
I don't know if you can hear me.
Never see you coming around
They know they got their heads screwed on
I'm standing in the middle of town
I know I might never come home
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me
The sound of all these passers-by mixed in with the bus and motor-car
I must be sure these are the signs
'Cause I've been here a million times before

Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down
Bringing you round

Tell me if I'm bringing you down
'Cause I was fine till you came along
You tell me that the tears of a clown cloud
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind
So far away I wanna be
That's not as close to you and me
The things they call our destiny
Now why'd you have to pick on me at all?
My walls are coming down

Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down
Coming around, coming around

Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, just dragging you down
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, just dragging you down
It's coming around, hey
It's coming around
I'm always thinking
Of someone new
I'm never sitting
OK with you
There's always something else on my mind
There's always something I can't find

[Chorus]
You think about anything you can
I think about you
I'll think about anything it's true

I'm almost perfect
Some of the time
I'm also sinking
Some of the time

I'm almost ready
Yeah, it's almost true
For almost anyone but you

[Chorus]

I'm always sinking
Beneath the sand
You're holding nothing in your hand

[Chorus]
Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I don't care
How many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To a tree with roots
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere
I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it
And Everybody says
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, no are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair!
Mary steers clear of the men from space
Back alley kid with an American face
She wants the wine
He brings a case
To carry them on through
 
You know what I know about the bedroom boys	
Undercover Russians in a pink Rolls-Royce
They bang the drum
She sets the beat
They carry Miss America out into the street
She sings “Snowman! Scarecrow! John Doe! Buffalo!”
 
I wish you wouldn’t go
I got the arms to reach you
I am the scarecrow
I guess you ought to know
I got the hands to teach you
I am the scarecrow
Snowman sideshow
 
I fell out of love in the snowbound days
Riding the subway in a Valium haze
I need the whites
She gets the blues
It carries us on through
 
All these American boys at the Park ‘n’ Shop
Selling their memories for a dollar a pop
Ivan the ancient spaceman race fan
Corners the market on American tastes
And says “Spaceman! Scarecrow! Peepshow! Freakshow!”
 
I wish you wouldn’t go
But I got the arms to reach you
I am a scarecrow
I guess you ought to know
That I got the hands to teach you
I am the scarecrow
Punk rock video
 
All the sudden light inside you dies
Maybe you’re going on alone
Maybe you’re going all alone
She dreams of sunlight
Sings of smaller things
White sugar bowls and wedding rings
You’re going on from me alone
You’re going on
You’re on your own
 
She was married alive in a Moscow surgery
Hoping to die in a cold war nursery
All of the kids back home believe in much more than we do
 
It’s a memory play where the memory fades
Into pictures you took
Into records we played
Spy vs Spy
Scarecrow and I
Out across the darkness where the bomberjets fly
Singing “Spaceman! Smokeshow! Scarecrow! Geronimo!”
 
I wish you wouldn’t go
I got the arms to reach you
I am a scarecrow
I guess you ought to know
I got the hands to teach you
I am the scarecrow
Snowman Freakshow
 
I wish you wouldn’t go but I got the arms to reach you
I am the scarecrow
I guess you ought to know
That I got the hands to teach you
I am the scarecrow
Listen on the midnight radio
When you disapear on me it's like parades in the rain, 
Every time I see you, you just disapear again. 
Every time your leavin' I don't know what to say. 
I wanna see all that damn go away. 

So would you tell me, why your leavin' 
'Cause' I don't know why it has to be so. 
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'? 
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. 

All this everlasting love songs, come into my eyes. 
Every time I see you. I'm alive. I'm alive. 

So could you tell me, why your leavin' 
'Cause I don't know why it has to be so. 
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'? 
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know
Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I don't care

Down in the easy chair!

Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair!
I lit out from Reno,
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night
'Till the morning came around.

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight,
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe,
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin' but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight,
I just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And vanished in the air.

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight,
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Got two reasons why I cry
Away each lonely night,
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
And she's my hearts delight.
The second one is prison, baby,
The sheriff's on my trail,
And if he catches up with me,
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe,
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child,
But it don't look like me.
Set out runnin' but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight,
I just might get some sleep tonight.

You can borrow from the devil
You can borrow from a friend
The devil'll loan ya twenty
But your friend got only ten
Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
So I headed west to grow up with the country
Out across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge,
Last night at half past two
The switch man waved his lantern goodbye
And so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
That I've never been shown
And I saw my devil,
And I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt
And lit out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers 
And all other instruments of faith and sex and God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to feed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been crying, I've been thinking 
And I am the rain king 

I said mama, mama, mama 
Why am I so alone? 
I can't go outside, I'm scared, I might not make it home 
But I'm alive, but I'm sinking in 
If there's anyone home at your place 
Why don't you invite me in? 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been there before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been lying, I've been sinking 
And I am the rain king 

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun 
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends 
After all the dreaming I come home again 

When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying 
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been dying 
And I've been drinking and I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king, yeah
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
Cross the water and home through the town
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
Pretty soon I won't come around
 
I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly fallen to her knees
 
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
Where all the bodies hang on the air
If she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet
Either way now, I don't really care
 
I'm almost drowning in her seas
She's nearly crawling on her knees
She's down on her knees
 
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
I'm just another rider burned to the ground
 
I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly crawling on her knees
It's almost everything I need
I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees
She brings her friends so we wont have to be alone
Fear I might lose my composure without warning
I am a child of fire I am a lion I have desires
And I was born inside the sun this morning

[Chorus]
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree

They say good evening when they don't know what to say
They say good morning when they wish you would go home

You open windows and you wait for someone warm to come inside and then freeze to death alone

[Chorus]

She calls a waitress when its time for her to go
And I know everyone is eventually leaving
I got a pair of wings for my birthday baby and I will fall down through the sun to see you mine

[Chorus]

For me, for me, for me [Repeated]

This dizzy life is just a hanging tree
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me

This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me
For me, for me, for me [Repeated]

This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me
Well I woke up in mid-afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most
I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast

Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame
And though I'll never forget your face,
sometimes I can't remember my name

Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything

Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed

Hey Mrs. Potter don't go
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep

So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem
But I'd sure like to find out
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen

Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor
and orders another
Well, I wonder what he did that for
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door

We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars
You can see a million miles tonight
But you can't get very far

Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me
Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl
I said, Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl

Had a lot of girlfriends
I should have known them
Click your heels and count back from there
Do you want to go back?
You should have known
That the butterfly in reverse here is me

Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl
I said, Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl

Where'd you want to go to
With nothing beside you
But webbing and curfews and rain?
And everything that hurts you
Is locked up inside you
Like butterflies with wings
And other perfect things

We go swimming in the sunshine
Dangling from clotheslines
Separate and fall into me
But did you ever see me?
Me, absolutely?
Me, but all you, but still me?

Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They took a lot of time
Getting it right on this girl, I said
Mary-Ann
You're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl
All of the sudden she disappears
Just yesterday she was here
Somebody tell me if I am sleeping
Someone should be with me here
(Cause I don't wanna be alone)

I wanna be the knife that cuts into my hand
And I wanna be scattered from here in this catapult
What a big baby won't somebody save me please
You won't find nobody home

All of these quiet battered voices
Wait for the hunger to come
We got little revolvers and stupid choices
And no one to say when we're done
(Well I don't wanna bring you down)

I wanna be the light that burns out your eyes
`Cause I know there's little things about me
That would sing in the silence of so much rejection
In every connection I make
I can't find nobody home
I wanna be the last thing you hear when you're falling asleep....

Is everybody happy now?
Is everybody clear?
We could drive out to the dunes tonight,
'cause summer's almost here.
And I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.

When the roads are clear,
We'll head on out of here,
If you're coming back, 
I'll see you in the morning
I'm just staring at
The ceiling staring back at me,
Just waiting for the daylight 
To come crawling in on me

And I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
And let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Oh, it's too late to get high now.

And I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
And let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Oh, it's too late to get high now.

Fix your hair just right
Put your jeans on tight,
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy.
'Cause I've been thinking I'd
Like to see your eyes
Open up real wide the minute that you see me.
If you don't come through,
I wouldn't wait for you.
I understand that everyone goes disappearing,
Into the greatest gray
That covers over everyday,
And hovers in the distance 
And the distance and the distance

I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Oh, it's too late to get high now.

I've been up all night,
I might sleep all day.
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away,
I might sleep all day.
Oh, it's too late to get high now.

Baby I'm not alone
Only want to get high.
My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, "For one time only,
Make an exception."
I am not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned with the status of my emotions
"Oh," she says, "you're changing."
But we're always changing

It does not bother me to say this isn't love
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you try to tell yourself
To make yourself forget
I am not worried
"If it's love," she said, "then we're going to have to
think about the consequences."
She can't stop shaking
I can't stop touching her and

This time when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
"These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering
for days," she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
I'm not going to bend and I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore
No no no no no,
It seems like I should say, "As long as this is love"
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should
Snap her up in a butterfly net
Pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and

The time when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind
And every time she sneezes I believe it's love and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away
She disappears and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing
I never go to New York City these days
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Maybe in a month or two,
Maybe when things are different for me,
Maybe when things are different for you
You know all of this shit, just sticks in my head
Is there anything different these days?
The light in her eyes goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are different these days
It's good for everybody to hurt somebody once in a while
The things I do to people I love shouldn't be allowed
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me
Is there anything different these days?
The light in her eyes goes out,
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are different these days
I dream I'm in New York City some nights.
Angels flow down from all the buildings
Something about an angel just kills me
I keep hoping something will
Is there anything different these days?
The light in her eyes goes out,
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are, maybe maybe maybe
Maybe things are, maybe maybe maybe maybe things are different,
Maybe things are different these days
The light goes out
I never had light in my eyes anyway
Maybe things are different?these days.

Poor old granddad, I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
He said they'll trap you and they'll use you and before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Boy, don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

The can-can such a pretty show
It will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
All them dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find, yeah
You're just a boy again

He said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
And if you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
I say poor young grandson there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn it just like me
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
Yeah ooh la la
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh ooh la la
Everybody sing

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

I said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

Hey I said ooh la la, ooh la la yeah yeah
Ooh la la, oh ooh la la la la la la
Say ooh la la
Oh ooh la la la la la la la la la
Oh ooh la la
I said ooh la la
Everybody sing

I said I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Ooh la la
Just down the street from your hotel, baby
I stay at home with my disease
And ain't this position familiar, darling
Well, all monkeys do what they see
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

Down on Virginia and La Loma
Where I got friends who'll care for me
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted
I got an attitude of need
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion
Try to keep myself away from me

It's 4:30 A.M. on a Tuesday
It doesn't get much worse than this
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle
of these lives which are completely meaningless
Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion
Try to keep myself away from myself and me

I got bones beneath my skin, and mister...
There's a skeleton in every man's house
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
There's a dead man trying to get out
Please help me stay awake, I'm falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion baby
Try to keep myself away from me
The devil's in the dreaming
He tells you I'm not sleeping in my hotel room alone
With nothing to believe in
You dive into the traffic rising up
And it's so quiet
You're surprised
And then you wake

For all the things you're losing
You might as well resign yourself to try and make a change
I'm going down to Hollywood
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find 
crawling round my brain

I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep
I wish for all the world that I could say,
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."

The devil's in the dreaming
You see yourself descending from a building to the ground
You watch the sky receding
You spin to see the traffic rising up
And it's so quiet
You're surprised
And then you wake

For all the things I'm losing
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change
But I'm going down to Hollywood 
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find
crawling round my brain

I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me
And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep
I wish for all the world that I could say,
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."

In one of these dreams, you forgive me
It makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home
How could anyone else have changed?
All these wrong conclusions that leave you alone
How could everyone rearrange?
How could everyone else have changed?
What I see I believe

For all the things I'm losing
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change
Well, I'm going down to Hollywood
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find
crawling around my brain

I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep
I wish for all the world that I could say,
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."

But I can't sleep at night

Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you
It's getting cold in California
I guess I'll be leaving soon

Daylight fading
Come and waste another year
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading
We leave just before it's gone

She said "Everybody loves you,"
She says, "Everybody cares"
But all the things I keep inside myself
They vanish in the air
If you tell me that you'll wait for me
I'll say I won't be here
I want to say goodbye to you
Goodbye to all my friends
Goodbye to everyone I know

Daylight fading
Come and waste another year
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading
We leave just before it's gone

Sunday morning LA coming down in a KG71,
I wasn't coming to stay,
Going back to the real life soon enough,
Every things all good,
And Everyone is cool,
I'm only leaving down the coast,
Now all I want is something more,
L.A. time today,
I've been riding a wheel that's coming off,
I had the right of way all the time,
And I feel I'm getting lost,
Just coming around the block,
Hey you seem like a nice kid lets get off,
I just realized that is all fun,
Get off on life and the journey south.

Moving time today,
Someone doing the same things I have done,
We never get away,
These stupid sinners the angels all have guns,
And they're only here until its done,
We only here until we're gone,
Yeah, gone, gone, gone, gone.
I said goodnight L.A.
'Cause I'm awake in my room
I've been up for 38 hours
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon

'Cause I could break like a bird
Or I could swallow the sea
It seems like the daylight is coming
And no one is watching but me

But I don't mind the dark
Discovering the day
'Cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray

What brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love

And it's a dangerous time
For a heart on a wire
Shuttle from station to station
Noisily not knowing why

So I put my head on the ground
And the sky is a wheel
Spinning these days into things that I've lost
But you can keep all the years

But I don't mind the days
Gone rolling away
'Cause all this sunlight feels warm on my face today

But what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough
And what brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough, never get enough
Never get enough, no no, never get enough, no oh no
And still I can never get enough of love

And what brings me, brings me down now is love
'Cause I can never get enough of love
I can never get enough of love
I can never ever get enough
I can never get enough of love

Have you seen the little pieces of the people we have been?
Little pieces blowing' gently on the wind
They have flown down California
They have landed in L.A.
Little pieces slowly settling on the waves

I'm one of a million pieces fallen on the ground
It's one of the reasons when we say goodbye
We'll still come around We will come around

I have waited for tomorrow from December 'til today
I have started loving sorrow along the way
I am calling from some city
And I won't be there too long
I could wait and I could waste away
But what comes back is I hear you say we're gone

For all of the times that I go spinning up and down
When all of the things have died between us
Well, we'll still come around We will come around
After I've been missing for a while
And you hear that summer's song
Haven't all the fading lines lingered on?

What I know is: she's going
When you know it, it's alright
So you put yourself between you and your pride
If you wait for what's coming
And you listen to her lies,
Then she'll say the things you need to hear
And the only one who'll disappear is you

And one of the million lies she said
Is "All of the things you love are dead."
But I've seen what she thinks is love
And it leaves me laughing so we'll still come around
She don't want nobody near
But you can't get away from that
They appear and disappear
And they all get a string attached
Pretty soon they got you hanging on a line
Pretty soon they're singing one by one the same old rhyme
They say, "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."

She don't want nobody home
'Cause it's a little too crowded then
But she don't wanna be alone
So they just keep pouring in
Pretty soon they got her headed for the door
She comes home to find that they're not hanging 'round no more
She says "I'm alright, you just can't get home tonight."

Don't you wonder what she looks like in the light?
She says "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."

Pretty whitewashed lies
Endless alibis
And the reasons that need cleaning every night
Half a world away
You can't wash away the stain of the deceiving
And the things that you cannot believe, and well

She don't want no one around
'Cause she don't want anybody to see
What she looks like when she's down
'Cause that's a really sad place to be
Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls
Then she wonders why they beg her please to never call
She says, "I'm ok. It's alright. Hey, look who's on TV tonight."
She says, "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."

Don't you wonder why it's dark outside at night?
She says, I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight.
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmm
Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance the silence down through the morning
Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes
Yeah

Mr Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
Ah, no, no, she's looking at me
Smilin' in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so
She's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be
Lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe
Yeah!

Mr Jones and me
Stumbling through the Barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you
Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr Jones and me
Starin' at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I'm wanna be just about as happy as I can be
Mr Jones and me
We're gonna be big stars
I was born again a little north of Disneyland
Somewhere under Wonderland
In Hollywood
But then I had to go
Skipping and diving and bouncing 
back to New York City
Straight through the heart of America
Where all the wild things grow

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I live alone but I am hungry for affection
I just struggle with connection
Til the water calls me home
Down under the ocean
Among millions of other lonely people
Drowning among the only people
We are ever going to know

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I wanna be like the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away
Is I’m tied into the lightning line
I wanna see if the sun is shining
Long night’s just a waste of time
I don’t wanna see people like me
Just sleeping and waking and hoping and hating and…

You look at me like I’m a carnival attraction
You say “Love is an abstraction
Just some ghost that you chase”
Well, I am a cypher
I am a blank space
Filled up with words you remember
From whenever you see my face

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I wanna be like all the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away
Is I’m plugged into the lightning line
I wanna be where the sun is shining all night
Chasing time
I don’t wanna be with people like me
Just creeping and waking and 
hoping and hating and…

What is the price for all this fame and self-absorption?
We turn ourselves into orphans
And then spend our nights alone
Living in fear of some imaginary consequence
Terror incognito
O-bla-di		
Li-bi-do

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home
Staring out of his window as the world rushes by
Arthur Robinson closes the glass and replies,
"I dream of Ballerinas and I don't know why 
But I see Cadillac's sailing

I was born on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today
So I am endlessly waiting

And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.

Carrie's down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins
From where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again

And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.

I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side
In a house where regret is a carousel ride
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now...

There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell
There's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well'
I may not go to heaven

I hope you go to hell
And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.
November promises, it seems, 
Are broken February dreams that don’t come true
Do you remember me?
I don’t remember you
Were you the one who liked to sing?
Or just some other one?
It’s strange how Paige remains
She stays the same
We’re always changing

We are driving on the ceiling
There are aliens on motorcycles
Riding in the radio while we destroy the world
I said “Oh! Oh! Oh No! No!”
The news it read: The Future’s Dead”
When Elvis went to Hollywood
That’s when everything went wrong

"So long. Goodbye”
The taste of wedding cake
The sound of nursery rhymes
The ghosts of Fredericksburg, of Alex Chilton,
Of Victor Frankenstein
The girl you’ll always love
The one you have no memory of
It’s strange how Paige remains
She prays for rain on The Invasion

We are driving on the ceiling
There are aliens on motorcycles
Hiding in the radio while we devour the world
I said “Oh! Oh! Oh no! No!”
The Future said: The News Is Dead
When Elvis went to Hollywood
That’s when everything went wrong

The God of Maine proclaims
The last evacuation of The Dream
The gospels scream a song of movie stars and girlie magazines
And spacemen too from somewhere far away
You have to say it’s strange
We prayed in vain
The rockets came and now we’re fading

We are hiding on the ceiling
There are aliens on motorcycles
Riding from the radio while they destroy the world
I said “Oh! Oh! Oh no! No!”
The papers said: The King Is Dead
When Elvis went to Hollywood
That’s when  everything went wrong
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
Cross the water and home through the town
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
Pretty soon I won't come around

I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly fallen to her knees

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
Where all the bodies hang on the air
If she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet
Either way now, I don't really care

I'm almost drowning in her seas
She's nearly crawling on her knees
She's down on her knees

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.
I'm just another rider burned to the ground

I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly crawling on her knees
It's almost everything I need
I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees

A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love - is all of heaven away
(CHORUS)
Inside you the times moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
A race is on
I'm on your side
And here in you
My engines die
I'm in a mood for you
Or running away
Stars come down in you
And love - you can't give it away
(CHORUS)
Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talk
And supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain
And love - is only heaven away
(CHORUS)
Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping
Wide awake, there's some pills that you shouldn't take

Honest to God, X is always an unknown
I said alright, Y gets buried in your bones
I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest
You don't have to stay around, you don't have to solve for X

I'm afraid I found it's eternally unequal
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight
On the way back down, finally a sequel,
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight

Is it alright, and your exit's always an unknown
It's hard to hold on too tight, 'cause I got buried with your bones
And I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest
All your reason gone tonight, you don't have to solve for X

Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping
Wide awake, there's some pills that I shouldn't take

And I said alright, X is always an unknown
I tried to hold on too tight but I got buried with the bone
And I said honest to God, I got to get it off my chest
I don't want to stick around, 'cause I don't need this suffering
Got a message in my head
That the papers had all gone
Richard Manuel is dead
And the daylight's coming on
I've been wandering through the dark
Now I'm standing on the lawn

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Well it was cold when I woke
And the day was halfway done
Nearly spring in San Francisco
But I cannot feel the sun
You were sleeping next to me
But I knew that you'd be gone

If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Take some time before you go
Think of Monday's coming down
And the people that you knew
The ones that aren't around
You've been fading day to day
I've been moving town to town

[x2]
If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You're a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of a clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Treading around in the gathered rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
Oh would you drop a line my way?

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Oh oh yeah

Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Threading his toes through a bucket of rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
'Cause you're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new life over
In the middle of the day 
There's a young man rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister if you're going to walk on water, you know
You're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Omaha
Oh somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
Oh it's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Omaha!
Say Omaha on a Sunday morning
I'm coming home today
Cowboys on the road tonight
Crying in their sleep
If I was a hungry man with a gun in my hand,
And some promises to keep,
Who wanted to change the world,
What's as easy as murder?
It's all headlights and vapour trails
And Circle K killers

And I know I could look at anyone but you now
I could fall under the eyes of anyone
But you now, now, now, now

So come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now
Come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now

This is a list of what I should have been
But I'm not
This is a list of the things that I should have seen
But I'm not seeing
The look in your eyes
As his fingertips slid down your neck
And made you shiver
I'm just turning away from where I should have been
Because I am not anything
Oh, anything, oh

The President's in bed tonight
But he can't get to sleep
'Cause all the cowboys on the radio are killers
And I believe she loves you
'Cause you never make her feel like anything
She said, "I wouldn't feel a thing,
But I can feel, I can feel

And I know I could look at anyone but you now
I could fall under the arms of anyone
But you now, now, now, now

So come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now
Come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now

This is a list of what I should have been
But I'm not
This is a list of the things that I should have seen
But I am not seeing
The look in your eyes
As his fingers are unzipping your dress
And it makes you shiver
I'm just turning away from what I shouldn't see
Because I am not anything
Oh, anything, no

Everyone's in bed tonight
But nobody can sleep
'Cause all the satellites are watching through our windows
She says she doesn't love me, like, like she's acting
But it's as if she isn't talking
'Cause Mr. Lincoln's head is bleeding
On the front row while she's speaking

I said, "come on all you cowboys,
All you blue-eyed baby boys,
Oh come on all you dashing gentlemen of summer,
I'll wait for you where Saturday's a memory,
And Sunday comes to gather me,
Into the arms of God who welcome me,
Because I believe, oh I believe

And I know I could look at anyone but you now
I could fall under the eyes of anyone
But you now, now, now, now

So come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now
Come on, come on, come on
Oh, come on through now

This is a list of what I should have been
But I'm not
This is a list of the things that I should have seen
But I'm not seeing you look at me
So please, won't you look at me?
'Cause I'm not seeing you look at me
Oh, oh, I, I will make you look at me
Or I am not anything
Oh, anything
No no no no
No no no no
No, no
Children in bloom cooking in the sun
Waiting for a room of our own
Leave my sister alone
She don't deserve this
She is a flower and I am a flower and
We are all alone

I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home

All these wasted dreams
Waiting for the sun to open up my heart to anyone
Bring me some rain
Because I'm dying and I can't get this damn thing closed again

I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home

Where's the funhouse this year?
The fairground's deserted and the skies don't seem as near
Nicole's my oldest friend
But the altar is empty and she'll never be a little girl again

I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home
I can't find my way home

All my friends got flowers in their eyes
But I got none this season
All of last years blooms have gone and died
Time doesn't give a reason
Hey baby, do you ask yourself sometimes
What you need to be forgiven?
Everything that you've ever done wrong
Is the reason that I'm driven
Straight to you

Waiting here for you 
Wanting to tell you
How I get my ends and my beginnings mixed up too
Just the way you do 
Thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two

Waiting for the trains that just never come
Beginning to believe in 
the disappearing nature of the people we have been
We have begun to change into the worst kind of people
So unkind
Oh apologies, no apologies, this apology
Doesn't describe the way it feels to feel for you

Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I find myself slowly disappearing too
Just the way you do
Thought if I told you
You might want to help me to remain with you

I just wanna stay for a little while
I wanna stay for a little while
There's a night life falling down on me
I just feel like a change
Beneath the sun in the summer, 
a sea of flowers won't bloom without the rain
But oh, this desert life, this high life
Here at the dying end of the day
I wasn't made for this scene baby
But I was made in this scene
And baby it's just my way
I don't wanna go home alone, I wanna come on home to you

Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use
Just the way you do
Thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two

Margery's dreaming of the middle of the day
Tiyuri to win
Perfect Dozen to place
money is the matter that's been on her mind
time ticks by her one race at a time
 
She's tryin' to be a good girl
And give 'em what they want
But Margery's dreaming of horses
Lookin' at a green sky
Sun like a red eye
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by
She's tired and lonely
Scared and depressed
Her visions of one day go racing the next
 
She's trying to be a good girl
And give 'em what they want
But Margery's dreaming of horses
Margie doesn't say anything all the way home
So afraid she'll awake to find she's all alone
Margery's wingspan's all feathers and coke cans, and
TV dinners and letters she won't send, and
Every race night is shot through with sunlight
Trying to hit the big one one last time tonight for...

Drunken fathers and stupid mothers and
Boys who can't tell one girl from another
So she takes her pills
Careful and round
One of these days she's gonna throw the whole bottle down
 
But she's trying to be a good girl
And give 'em what they want
But Margery's dreaming of...
 
Trying to be a good girl
And give 'em what they want 
But Margery's dreaming of horses
It's 1:30 in the morning
That's alright by me
You just waiting by the phone
I should give a little warning
But I need the things I need
I'm not proud to need a hand
But I just don't understand

[Chorus]
So, Why should you come when I call
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go, when I go
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own

Ain't necessarily a bad thing
To believe the things I say
Cause you can make yourself feel good
You know it's really not a good thing
To give everything to me
I'm just waiting for the show
Cause I got no where to go

[Chorus]

Cause nothing makes me feel so good
Gets me high
So I sleep at night
And that's enough and everything
Alright
I feel nice
So sorry in the morning
Could believe what you believe
I'm used to waking up alone
And if you think about it
Anyone you think about is a better love than me
But if you've not fallin' quite asleep?
I might call tonight
If that's alright

[Chorus]
Get away from me
This isn't gonna be easy
But I don't need you
Believe me
You got a piece of me
But it's just a little piece of me
And I don't need anyone
And these days I feel like I'm fading away
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio

Have you seen me lately?

I was out on the radio starting to change
Somewhere out in America
It's starting to rain
Could you tell me the things you remember about me
And have you seen me lately?

I remember me
And all the little things
That make up a memory
Like she said she loved to watch me sleep
Like she said,
"It's the breathing
It's the breathing in and out and in and..."

Have you seen me lately?

Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I don't care
How many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't going nowhere
Oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To a tree with roots
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere
I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it
And Everybody says
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, no are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

I said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair!

Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
I said oh no, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair!
It's 1:30 in the morning
That's alright by me
You just waiting by the phone
I should give a little warning
But I need the things I need
I'm not proud to need a hand
But I just don't understand
So, Why should you come when I call

I never say nothing at all
Why do I go, when I go
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Ain't necessarily a bad thing

Why do I go, when I go
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmm
Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance the silence down through the morning
Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah

Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes
Yeah

Mr Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
Ah, no, no, she's looking at me
Smilin' in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so
She's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be
Lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe
Yeah!

Mr Jones and me
Stumbling through the Barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you
Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr Jones and me
Starin' at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I'm wanna be just about as happy as I can be
Mr Jones and me
We're gonna be big stars
I get so nervous I'm shaking
Gets so I got no pride at all
Gets so bad but I just keep coming back for more
I guess I just get off on that stuff

I'm thinking about taking some time
I'm thinking about leaving soon

I got some things I can't tell anyone
I got some things I just can't say
They're the kind of things no one knows about
I just need somebody to talk to me

I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow
I'm thinking about being on my own
I think I been wasting my time
I'm thinking about getting out

In all this time, 
The bottom line's you don't know how much I feel
You say you see but I don't agree
You don't know how I feel

I'm just trying to get myself some gravity
You're just trying to get me to stay
Sometimes I sit here looking down upon Los Angeles
Sometimes I'm floating away

I'm thinking about breakin myself
I'm thinking about getting back home
I think I been waiting for way too long
I'm thinking about getting out

Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand
Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand?
I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now
Where'd you come from? Where am I going?
Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for...

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming
Every night these silhouettes appear above my head
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper
Every time I fall asleep Every time I dream
"Did you come? Would you lie?
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for...

Waiting for you"
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything
I'll only stand here

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

She comes to me at night when I'm sleeping
She comes to me when I'm alone
She comes to me She holds my head when I'm crying
She comes to me She shuts my eyes
She brings me home

But I'm not sleeping anymore

She tells me when you look at me She tells me when you're lying
She tells me when you talk about me She lays me on the floor
She tells me when you're whispering She lies beside me naked
She tells me when you laugh at me
and she locks all the doors

But I'm not sleeping anymore

1-2-3-4-5-6-7a.m.
All alone again
But I've been through all this shit before
Spend my nights in self defense
Cry about my innocence
But I ain't all that innocent anymore

I see her on the TV I see her in the movies
I see her in these animals that dance inside my head
I'll follow you down baby Down into this valley
I'll follow you down baby But I won't come up again

But I'm not sleeping anymore

Sha la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh
Uh, huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Starin' at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful, we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the mornin'

Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
Ah, no, no, she is looking at me
Smilin' in the bright lights
Comin' through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well I'm a paint my picture
Paint myself in blue, red, black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well you know, gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standin' in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Ah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe
Yeah

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the Barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you
Ah son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me starin' at the video
When I look at the television
I wanna see me starin' right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just about as happy as I can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
She comes out on Fridays every time
And stands out in a line
I could've been anyone she'd seen

She waits another week to fall apart, 
She couldnt make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could've been anyone you see
She had something breakable just under her skin

American girls all weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making it feel so incredible

She comes out of closets every night
But then she locks herself away
Where she could keep everything from me
I could've been anyone you see
She's nothing but porcelain underneath her skin

American girls are weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
Little shiver shaking me everyday
But I could get this same thing anywhere
So if she goes away, well, it's alright and I'm ok
She said come back again tonight
and I said I might I might I might
She said well that's alright
If it's alright, it's alright with you
And it's alright if it's alright with me

I waited for an hour last Friday night, she never came around
She took almost everything from me
I'm goin' through my closets, tryin' on her clothes almost everyday

I could've been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothin but pills and ashes under my skin

American girls are weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

If I made you cry, please tell me why
I'll try again if you let me try
American girls are feathers and cream
Come into bed so edible
American girls, oh American girls
American girls, oh oh oh oh
American girls, oh American girls
American girls, oh oh oh oh

You made me cry 
You made me cry 
You made me cry 
You made me cry
Yeah, you made me cry
You made me cry
Hey miss American girl
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh yeah

She is trapped inside a month of grey
And they take a little every day
She is a victim of her own responses
Shackled to a heart that wants to settle
And then runs away
It's a sin to be fading endlessly
Yeah, but she's alright with me

She is leaving on a walkaway
She is leaving me in disarray
In the absence of a place to be
She stands there looking back at me
Hesitates, and then turns away
She'll change so suddenly
She's just like mercury
Yeah, but she's alright with me

Keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds
For the things that die before their time
For the restlessly abandoned homes
The tired and weary rambler's bones
And stay beside me where I lie
She's entwined in me
Crazy as can be
Yeah, but she's alright with me

I said, "Goodnight L.A."
Cause I'm awake in my room
I been up for thirty eight hours
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon

Cause I could break like a bird
Or I could swallow the sea
It seems like the daylight is coming
And no one is watching but me

But I don't mind the dark discovering the day
Cause the night
Is a beautiful bright blue and grey

And what brings me down now is love
Cause I can never get enough

And it's a dangerous time for a heart on a wire
Shuttled from station to station noisily
Now knowing why

So I put my head on the ground
And the sky is a wheel
Spinning these days into things that I've lost
But you can keep all the years

But I don't mind the days gone rolling away
Cause this sunlight
Feels warm on my face today

And what brings me down now is love
Cause I can never get enough of love
She comes out on Fridays every time
Stands out in a line
I could've been anyone she'd seen
She waits another week to fall apart
She couldn't make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could have been anyone you see
She had something breakable just under her skin

American girls all weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

She comes out of closets every night
Then she locks herself away
Where she could keep everything from me
I could have been anyone you'd seen
she's nothing but porcelain underneath her skin

American girls all weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
Little shiver shaking me every day
But I could get the same thing anywhere
So if she goes away
Well, it's all right and I'm OK
"Hey" she said, "Come back again tonight"
And I said "I might, I might, I might"
She said "well that's all right"
If it's alright with you
It's alright with me

I waited for an hour last Friday night
She never came around
She took almost everything from me
I'm going through my closet,
trying on her clothes almost every day
I could've been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothing but pills and ashes under my skin

American girls all weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

If I made you cry, please tell me why
Cause I'll try again if you let me try
American girls all feathers & cream
Coming into bed so edible
American girls oh
American girls
American girls
Oh, oh, oh, oh

American girls oh
American girls
American girls
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You make me cry,
you make me cry,
you make me cry
Yeah, ya made me cry
You make me cry
Hey, miss American girl
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
She sat right down on the sofa
I said, "Where have you been? I've been waiting for you.
'Cause last night I had something so good
These days get so long and I got nothing to do"

I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long

We spend all day getting sober
Just hiding from daylight
Watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well, you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight
Weighed by the chains that keep me...

Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long

And this girl listens to the band play
She says "Where have you been?
I've been lyin' right here on the floor"

Well, I got all this time
To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded
Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way, way, way, way, way too long

I Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Way way, way, way, way too long
Goin' home from California,
Spend my money on the wine,
I pay my bills and get my fill,
'Cause the last of the traveling kind,
Don't want no damn religion,
Because I'm not prepared to die,
But I've been wrong,
Sometimes baby you can hide.

Well I told my doctor, doctor,
I gave all my love away,
I'm a bathroom boy if you've been my toy,
Well then I think better anyway,
And I will lie right down,
Beneath the ground,
When my time has come to go,
But until then man,
I gotta think that maybe I don't know,
I said until then girl,
I gotta think, maybe you don't know.

I get my sessions on the phone,
I'm gonna take my pills and spend my nights alone,
When I find myself the real thing I go home.

What I take us for, it's a midnight ploy,
We're on the road alone,
I cant get high but I know why,
I've done the things that I shouldn't have done,
Oh got the bills, I took my pill,
And went down for the night,
Oh for just one time,
To be with you and I could die,
I guess I don't know how to be alive.

I get my sessions on the phone,
I'm gonna take my pills and spend my nights alone,
When I find myself the real thing I go home.
It was a cold 3AM at JFK
I guess you stayed because you wanted to stay    
And we went from zero to everything all in a day
And then Kennedy took you away
 
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm
And the moments that make up your life until you wake up
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl
And she tells you she wanted to kiss you
And you know the worst part of a good day
Is hearing yourself say goodbye to one more possibility day
It goes on and on
 
I go west but your weather has changed
You’re just scared 
I mistake it for strange
When you want me to leave then you start to believe I should stay
But I gotta get out of LA
 
It seems like the short days are over
Cause you just don’t sleep in the daylight so I don’t sit up nights
I lie on my back on the top of a hill
And your body is breaking the sky because you’re shaking
And the worst part of a good day is knowing it’s slipping away
That’s one more possibility day that is gone
 
We were waiting for Winter this year
But you came and it never appeared
Me and you, we know too many reasons
For people and seasons that pass like they weren’t even here
 
Now “Living in smiles is better”, you say
But we carry the burdens of all of our days
So I’m scared that you’ll leave and you’re scared that I’ll stay
It’s an impossibility day
And we only saw half the ballet
 
I said goodnight Goodbye
It seems like a good thing so you know it’s a good lie
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head when you’re lying in bed

And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it’s okay
The color of everything changes
The sky rearranges its’ shade and your smile doesn’t fade
Into a phone call and one bad decision we made

And the worst part of a good day is the one thing you don’t say
And you don’t know how but you wish there was some way
So you pull down the shades and you shut off the lights
Because somehow we mixed up “Goodbye” and “Goodnight”

And the one you won’t say is 
"Everyone knows possibility days are impossible."
It just feels wrong		
So wrong
Still you’re gone			
Long gone
Lyrics
When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers 
And all other instruments of faith and sex and God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to feed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been crying, I've been thinking 
And I am the rain king 

I said mama, mama, mama 
Why am I so alone? 
I can't go outside, I'm scared, I might not make it home 
But I'm alive, but I'm sinking in 
If there's anyone home at your place 
Why don't you invite me in? 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been there before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been lying, I've been sinking 
And I am the rain king 

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun 
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends 
After all the dreaming I come home again 

When I think of heaven
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying 
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God 
In the belly of a black-winged bird 
Don't try to bleed me 
'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more 

I belong in the service of the Queen 
I belong anywhere but in between 
She's been dying 
And I've been drinking and I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king
'Cause I say I am the rain king, yeah
All dressed up
No place to go
Hey monkey, when you gonna show your face around me?
I know all the wrongs and rights
And I just want a little light to fall on me

Hey monkey, where you been?
This lonely spiral I've been in
Hey monkey, when can we begin?
Hey monkey, where you been?

We'll I'm all messed up
That's nothing new
Hey monkey, when you open up your blue eyes,
I don't know if I'm wide awake or dreaming
But all I ever need is everything

Hey monkey, where you been?
This lonely spiral I've been in
Hey monkey, when can we begin?
Hey monkey, where you been?

Just get the world off your shoulders
and close your pretty blue eyes
Hey monkey, what's life without an occasional surprise?

Got nowhere but home to go
Got Ben Folds on my radio right now 
I'm in trouble for the things I need
Hey monkey don't you want to be needed too?

Hey monkey, where you been?
This lonely spiral I've been in
Hey monkey, when can we begin?
Hey monkey, where you been?

I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning 
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
I want to be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

I will paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray 
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Greg is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you.
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me."
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I want to be a lion
Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
and I want to be someone to believe

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we star at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me."
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how 
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars..
Put on your bad self 
Get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try 
To make a good impression this is a new world 
Were all the same here, well maybe not the same you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything and someday Ill be president. 
I've for everything that you want 
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Separate, love from addiction its not the same I know 
I see desperation pulling my strings. Hey Eliza now what do you want? 
I play piano and I sing like a humming bird and oh I forgot 
That humming birds don't sing, it doesn't matter really you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything 
And its a brand new world eliza. I've got everything that you want
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Sail away blood and rejection ..they isolate. 

I know I see, a generation staring back at me.. 
Wasted away
Wasted my time this picture you see is nothing like the one 
I wanted painted of me. 
"Eliza says it's all right with me, if your sure 
It wouldn't be the first time, you know it's happened a couple of times before 
And.. I don't even expect much anymore and anyway
It's not as if I was waiting for you to come and make it all okay". 
Shut away to to wing blood and rejection they isolate 
I know I see visions of people grabbing hold of me. 
Wasted away, wasted my time
This picture you see is nothing like the one I wanted painted of me. 
Put on your bad self, get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try 
And make a good impression..
Can you see me up on a building
From down on the pavement
Or out in the crowd?

Can you see me, in the glare of the lamp post?
Cause I am walking a tightrope
Into the moon.

[Chorus]
I don't want feel so different,
But I don't want to be insignificant
And I don't how to see the same things different now.

Oh, can you see me? I am one in a million
Yeah, I'm Icarus falling, out of the sun.
She sees me falling, a line of spotlights and chalk lines.
Through night black as a bedroom
And white as a lie.

[Chorus]

Diving through the dark, while the night turns blue
And you wear your intentions, as I wear my intentions
So clear.

[Guitar Bridge]

If you see me, wading through water
Or come drowning a river
Right in front of the world

Hey you can wash your face and hands in the stream of my anger
Cause it's as bright as white paper
As dark as a girl

[Chorus: x2]
The gentleman caller in the blue suede shoes
He don't know what to do
He just wants to look good for you
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today
But he can't think of what to say
I think you listen anyway

He wants to have a good time just like everybody
He doesn't want to fall apart

You watch him as he stutters over what to say
It's just a little game you play
It's no easier for you some days
You wish that you could tell him it'll be okay
But you feel a little shy these days
Cause everybody goes away

You just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
You don't want to fall apart this time

I can look into your eyes and see the
mess we're in
Well darling, if it's shit came out
Then I suppose it's shit went in
Even though I couldn't say I've been the
places you've been
You know he made my heart real strong
Even if he made my head real thin

I want to have a good time
Just like everybody
And I don't want to fall apart

I just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
And I don't want to fall apart this time
So would you please invite me in

I really love the red haired girls
I'm just another boy from Texas
Come on and take a spin
I got a brand new set of wings
I stepped out the front door into winter and the world outside
I stepped out the door to New York City
My hair was barely dry
I could not remember where I was going
So I went back inside
Nothing’s happening in the elevator
Nothing happening on the stairs
Nothing ever happens when I am sleeping
So I cannot stay there
How do you find the parties when you’re in your room?
How do you find the action?
Man, the action is everywhere

If you decide to climb outside your bedroom window
Paint a picture on a cloud
If you decide that you can’t hide inside
Your mind provides a slide to get you out
It feels just like you’re falling when you’re going down
But everybody loves you when you hit the ground

I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to Pocahontas
I pray to John Appleseed
Oh, I cigarette the winter air
And then I Fred Astaire my way down 7th Street
Some chick yells “Jesus loves me more than I know
But less than I need”

I parade down The Bowery to The Battery
And then I step off into the air
Point my sunglasses east toward Jerusalem
And then follow all the Pharaohs there
They’re building pyramids in Leicester Square
Driving in circles round the Circus til the circle’s in the air

My love says “Come on Adam
Tell me what the hell is wrong with you"
She says "Come on Adam
What the hell am I supposed to do?"
She says "I could love you, I could leave you
But I can't live w/what you put me through”

I call the wind Maria because I do not know her face
I call the endless sky Amelia
Because she stays with me from place to place
I call the sun my love Emmanuelle
Because she cradled me in her embrace
Nothing happening in the kitchen
Nothing happening on the floor
Nothing happening in my bed
But she don’t sleep there no more
How do you find the bottom when you’re in the air?
How do you find the circus?
Man, the circus is everywhere
Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here we always stand up straight
'Round here something radiates
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here we're carving out our names
'Round here we all look the same
'Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here she's slipping through my hands
Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, "It's only in my head."
She says, "Shh, I know it's only in my head."

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: "Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling."

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.

'Round here she's always on my mind
'Round here (hey man) I got lots of time
'Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very very very very late

I can't see nothing, nothing
Around here
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me because I'm falling down on here
I said " I'm under the gun"
'Round here.
Oh man I said "I'm under the gun"
'Round here.
And I can't see nothin', nothin'.
'Round here.
You know I don't like you
But you want to be my friend
There are bodies on the ceiling
And they are fluttering their wings
It's OK, I'm angry
But you'll never understand
You dream of Michelangelo
They hang above your hands

[Chorus]
And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes
Walking on my skin again

And I can't see why
You want to talk to me
When your vision of America
Is crystal and clean
I wanna white bread life
Just something ignorant in the rain
But from the walls of Michelangelo
I'm dangling again.

[Chorus]

Saturn on a line
The sun afire of strings and wires
Spin above my head and make it right
Anytime you'd like, you can catch a sight
Of angel eyes on emptiness and infinite
And I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
I see God upon the ceiling
I see angels overhead
And he seems so close
As he reaches out his hand
We are never quite as close
As we are led to understand

And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes walking walking walking
And I know, she is not my friend
And I know, cause there she goes
Walking on my skin again and again
On my mind
Oh Lord no
Yes she's walking on my skin again and again
