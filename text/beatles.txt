Lyrics
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's gotta be (Ooh)

There ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more (Ooh)

The weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad
But someday you're gonna see
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be

Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to squeeze and please 'cause I'm the one that loves you so
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, yeah) (fade out)
Ain't no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Oo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

Yeah the goosepimples baby
'Cause I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Oo mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over

Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah!

Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak

Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooo baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over.
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there.
Ring, my friend I said you'd call 
Doctor Robert 
Day or night he'll be there any time at all

Doctor Robert 

If you're down he'll pick you up 
Doctor Robert 
Take a drink from his special cup 
Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert 
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need 
No one can succeed like 
Doctor Robert 

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine 
Well, well, well, he'll make you 
Doctor Robert 

My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert 
Don't pay money just to see yourself
Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert 
You're a new and better man 
He help you to understand 
He does everything he can 
Doctor Robert 

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine 
Well, well, well, he'll make you

'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman
 
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,

Anna,
You come and ask me, girl,
To set you free, girl,
You say he loves you more than me,
So I will set you free,
Go with him.
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',

All of my life,
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.

You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.

Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.

Sexy Sadie, what have you done
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, ooh, what have you done

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you broke the rules

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along and turned on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, ooh, how did you know

Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you'll get yours yet

We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie
Motorcars, handlebars, bicycles for two 
Broken hearted jubilee

Why why, says the sign in the yard 
Buy buy, says the sign in the shop window 
Why why, says the junk in the yard
Rock And Roll Music
Just let me hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it,
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast,
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music 

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo,
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock and roll music
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
One day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
Ooh I need your love babe,
Guess you know it's true.
Hope you need my love babe,
Just like I need you.
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me.
Ain't got nothin' but love babe,
Eight days a week.

Love you ev'ry day girl,
Always on my mind.
One thing I can say girl,
Love you all the time.
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me.
Ain't got nothin' but love babe,
Eight days a week.

Eight days a week
I love you.
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care.

Ooh I need your love babe, ...
Eight days a week ...
Love you ev'ry ...
Eight days a week. Eight days a week. Eight days a week.
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see?
I want to be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you

Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah

Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running 
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah
Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah
Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah
Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah
Beep beep 'em beep beep, yeah
All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you

I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more

I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you
I think I'm gonna be sad,
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,

I think I'm gonna be sad,
I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep.
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long.
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart

But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do, can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you  (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true  (cheat, cheat)

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you, don't leave me all alone
I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed 
I'm looking through you, you're not the same 

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
(Berry)

I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
The love I crave
I can't find no more

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye.
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond'ring why,
I cried for you.

And now, you've changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, it's through, oh.

Oh, you're giving me the same old line,
I'm wond'ring why,
You hurt me then, you're back again,
No, no, not a second time.
Well, if your hands start a-clappin' 
And your fingers start a-poppin' 
And your feet start a-movin' around 
And if you start to swing and sway 

When the band starts to play 
A real cool way out sound 
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down 
You feel like you gotta move around 

You get a shot of rhythm and blues. 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure. 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes 

Well, with your lover by your side 
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
If you start to dance and sing 

And chills come up on you 
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
Well, here's something for you to do 

Get a shot of rhythm and blues 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes

Well, here's something for you to do 
Well, here's something for you to do 
Well, here's something for you to do
Well let me tell you well no chick made 
Could be the same 
As Sweet Georgia Brown. 
Crazy feet that dance so neat 
Has sweet Georgia Brown. 
Fella's sigh, and even cry 
For sweet Georgia Brown. 
I tell you just why 
You know I don't lie. 

It's been said 
She knocks them dead 
In any old town. 
Since she came right 
It's a shame 
How she brings them down. 
In Liverpool she even dare 
To critize the Beatles' hair. 
With their whole fanclub
Standing there 
I mean sweet Georgia Brown. 

I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you 
Think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial! 

When it comes to music
Sweet Georgia is known to mind, 
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows 
But she still looks fine 
Snap chicks cry, 
They want to die 
When Georgie does the twist 
I never would try 
To tell you just why. 
Use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her 
Living in out home town 
Since she came it's a shame 
She turns him down 
Records that she can get 
Are records, they ain't sent him yet 
Carolina may have Dina, 
But that don't have Georgia Brown. 

Oh that sweet Georgia, 
Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown, oh oh oh. 
Sweet Georgia Brown.
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Woman, I can hardly express 
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman, I will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Ooh, well, doo doo doo doo doo.
Ooh, well, well, doo doo doo doo doo

Woman, I know you understand the little child inside a man
Please remember, my life is in your hands, and woman
Hold me close to your heart, however distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars

Ooh, well 

Woman, please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again 
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, 
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (yes, it did)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come

You let your face grow long

(Oh I'm tired, servicible villain
Set you down father, rest you)
I'm sure to fall, fall in love, 
I'm sure to fall in love with you. 
You are so sweet and so near. 
I'm sure to fall in love with you. 

So hold me tight, 
And let tonight be the night. 
Darling, don't ever let me go. 
Loving you is the natural thing to do, 
I want you for the rest of my life. 

So hold me tight, 
Let tonight be the night. 
Oh darling, don't ever let me go. 
Loving you is the natural thing to do, 
I want you for the rest of my life.
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why,
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why,
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time
If you wear red tonight,
Remember what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that my baby wore,
And what is more, it's true,
Yes it is.
Scarlet were the clothes she wore,
Everybody knows I've sure.
I would remember all the things we planned,
Understand, it's true,
Yes it is, it's true.
Yes it is.
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is.
Oh, yes it is, yeah.
"Please don't wear red tonight."
This is what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that will make me blue,
In spite of you, it's true,
Yes it is, it's true.
Yes it is.
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is.
Oh, yes it is, yeah.
"Please don't wear red tonight."
This is what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that will make me blue,
In spite of you, it's true,
Yes it is, it's true.
Yes it is, it's true.
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can.
I've got to admit it's getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can.

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I should have known better with a girl like you,
That I would love everything that you do; and I do,
Hey, hey, hey, and I do.

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine,
You're gonna say you love me too

So oh I should realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine,
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too, you love me too
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Told me she's no longer mine.

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
You'll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when I'm lonely,
Wishing you weren't so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say you'll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, I'm just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
We'll go on and on.
Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
We'll go on and on.
Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey

I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way
Baby's good to me

She's in love with me and I feel fine

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

(Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain)

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
Cause I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Ooh baby
Say you're driving me insane
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your lover man

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl I want to marry you

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine.
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out

It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down
Filling me up with your rules

I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine...
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, whoa, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too.

So, oh, I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more.

Whoa, whoa, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too.

You love me too
You love me too.
You say you will love me 
If I have to go. 
You'll be thinking of me, 
Somehow I will know. 
Wishing you weren't so far away, 
Then I will remember 
The things we said today. 

You say you'll be mine, girl, 
Until the end of time. 
These days such a kind girl 
Seems so hard to find. 
Someday when we're dreaming, 
Deep in love, not a lot to say. 
Then we will try to remember 
The things we said today. 

Me, I'm just the lucky kind. 
Love to hear you say that love is luck. 
And, though we may be blind, 
Love is here to stay. And that's enough 
To make you mine, girl, 
Be the only one. 
Love me all the time, girl. 
We'll go on and on. 
Someday when we're dreaming, 
Deep in love, not a lot to say. 
Then we will try to remember 
The things we said today. 

Love me all the time, girl. 
We'll go on and on. 
Someday when we're dreaming, 
Deep in love, not a lot to say. 
Then we will try to remember

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) 
Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love
Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) 
Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you

I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you
It's so hard to reason with you
Woah yeah, why do you make me blue?

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) 
Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you
Me, woah yeah, like I please you
Me, woah yeah, like I please you
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
(J and D Burnette/Burlison/Mortimer)

Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow

I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?

You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again

Blues and sorrow
I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes
You're going to lose that girl

And I will take her out tonight 
And I will treat her kind

If you don't treat her right, my friend 
You're going to find her gone 
'Cause I will treat her right and then 
You'll be the lonely one 
You're going to lose that girl 
You're going to lose that girl 
You're going to lose 
I'll make a point of taking her away from you 
Yeah, the way you treat her, what else can I do

You're going to lose that girl 
You're going to lose that girl
(Help) I need somebody
(Help) not just anybody
(Help) you know I need someone
(Help)

(When) when I was younger (when I was young) so much younger than today
(I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) and now my life has changed (my life has changed) in oh-so-many ways (my independence)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) but every now and then (now and then) I feel so insecure (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you

All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Woo, all my loving, I will send to you
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way

And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure got a long way to go

I'm an old poor boy 
I'm a long way from home

And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
'Cause everything I ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches, honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you, baby

Watch how your puppy dog runs

Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure got a long way to go
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps.

Mister Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine, I think you're fine
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight
Mister Moonlight come again please
Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight
Mister Moonlight come again please
Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight
Mister Moonlight
I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia
Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Hum hum hum hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia, Julia, Julia
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Or I'll get a plan

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all the things you see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, love

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Da da da, da da dumb dumb da
Da da da, da da dumb dumb da

I think I'm gonna be sad,
I think it's today, yeah.
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away.

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah.
For she would never be free
When I was around.

[Chorus]

I don't know why she's ridin' so high,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me.
Before she gets to saying goodbye,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me.

I think I'm gonna' be sad,
I think it's today yeah.
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah.

[Chorus]

I don't know why she's ridin' so high,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me.
Before she gets to saying goodbye,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me,
Is bringing her down, yeah.
For she would never be free
When I was around.

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x3]
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.
Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still

Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Well you know I love baby
I'll never let you go

Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight
Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Ah! Wha'!

Well Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Oh Lucille
Yeah baby do your sister's will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place

Komm, gib mir deine Hand
Komm, gib mir deine Hand
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?

No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?

No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it, do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?

No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do

You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do
Yeah, love me do
Whoa, oh, love me do
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I got to give if you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no no no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love
Da da da, da da dumb dumb da
Da da da, da da dumb dumb da
If there's anything that you want

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go,
I would hate my disappointment to show,
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear,
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know.

I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there,
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long,
I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

Though tonight she's made me sad,
I still love her,
If I find her I'll be glad,
I still love her.

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door,
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four

You'll be older too,
And if you say the word,
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride,
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four

Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four
You know my name
Look up the number

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

I never knew that a day 
Like today lay before us. 
I've got the sun in my heart 
And my heart's in the sun. 

Skies are as bright 
As your eyes, 
The horizon is open. 
Love is the ceiling, 

Feelings are reelings 
Free as the air. 

Forever on and forever, 
Forever on side by side. 
Who ever knew that we two 
Could be free as we'd fancy, 

Fancy is free 
But are we bound 
To each other by love, 
To each other by love? 

Who ever knew that we two 
Could be free as we'd fancy, 
Fancy is free 
But are we bound 

To each other by love,

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look, having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh, ahh, ahh

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure got a long way to go

I'm an old poor boy 
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
'Cause everything I ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches, honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery, all right

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

Well, I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure got a long way to go
Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes,
smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby

Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time

I never give you my pillow,
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations,
I break down

Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time

Oh yeah, all right,
are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end,
the love you take,
is equal to the love you make,
Ah

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
One, two, three, four ! 
Well, she was just seventeen,
You know what I mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So how could I dance with another (ooh) 
And I saw her standin' there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)
And I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went "boom,"
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom,"
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there
I don't like you, but I love you,
Seems that I'm always thinking of you.
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly,
I love you madly, you really got a hold on me.
You really got a hold on me, baby,
I don't want you, but I need you,
Don't want to kiss you, but I need you.
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now,
My love is strong now you really got a hold on me.

You really got a hold on me, baby, 
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, 
Hold me, hold me, hold me.

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here 
Don't want to spend another day here.
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now, I can't Baby,
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, 
Hold me, hold me, hold me.
 
You really got a hold on me.
You really got a hold on me.
You really got a hold on me.
 
You really got a hold on me.
You really got a hold on me.
Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
(Help) I need somebody
(Help) not just anybody
(Help) you know I need someone
(Help)

(When) when I was younger (when I was young) so much younger than today
(I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) and now my life has changed (my life has changed) in oh-so-many ways (my independence)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) but every now and then (now and then) I feel so insecure (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh?
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Long distance information 
Give me Memphis Tennessee. 
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me. 
She would not leave her number 
But I know who placed the call. 
'Cause my uncle took the message 
And he wrote it on the wall. 

Help me, information, 
Get in touch with my Marie. 
She's the only one who'd phone me here 
From Memphis Tennessee. 
Her home is on the south side 
Just beyond the ridge, 
Just a half a mile 
From the Mississippi Bridge. 

Help me, information, 
More than that I cannot add. 
Only that I miss her 
And all the fun we had. 
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree. 
Help me get in touch with her 
In Memphis Tennessee. 

The last time I saw Marie 
She was waving me goodbye, 
With hurry homedrops on her cheek 
That trickled from her eyes. 
Marie is only six years old, 
Information please. 
Help me get in touch with her 
In Memphis Tennessee.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life 
You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasn't you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
'Cause I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

I've tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,

With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.

Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Nature's son.
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out

If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see

Not guilty 
For getting in your way 
While you're trying to steal the day. 
Not guilty 
And I'm not here for the rest, 
I'm not trying to steal your vest. 

I am not trying to be smart, 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry for your ageing head. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty. 

No use handing me a writ 
While I'm trying to do my bit. 

I don't expect to take your heart. 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry that you're underfed. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty. 

Not guilty 
For looking like a freak, 
Making friends with every Sikh. 
Not guilty 
For leading you astray 
On the road to Mandalay. 

I won't upset the apple cart. 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry that you've been misled. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty.
It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...
As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.
You say you want a revolution, well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution, well you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out, in

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you got a real solution, well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution, well you know
We're doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you'll have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you'll change the constitution, well you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution, well you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Alright, alright
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life-- I love you more
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
One day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart

But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do, can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you  (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true  (cheat, cheat)

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you, don't leave me all alone
The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees
Now give me money
That's what I want
That's what I want, yeah
That's what I want

You're lovin' gives me a thrill
But you're lovin' don't pay my bills
Now give me money

What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't

She don't give boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye

She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as loving
Don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman, she's a woman

That boy
Took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy 
Just to love you, but oh my 
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy, this boy, this boy
I was slipping and sliding with a long tall Sally
Peeking and a hiding,duck back in the alley
Don't want to rip it up,don't want to dance with Annie
I've got a brand new lover name is Short Fat Fannie

One day while I was visiting at Heart Break Hotel
That's where I met Fannie and she sure looked swell
I told her that I loved her and I'd never leave
She put her arms around me, gave me fever

She's my tutti fruity,I love the child so
She watch me like a hound dog everywhere I go
Whenever I'm around her I'm on my p's and q's
She might step on my blue suede shoes

Well at a honky tonk party just the other night
Fannie got jealous and she started a fight
At the club I was dancing with Mary Lou
I had to call Jim Dandy to the rescue
Short Fat Fannie she's my hearts desire
Short Fat Fannie sets my soul on fire
On Monday we were married on Blueberry Hill
Now we're so happy and I love her still

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before

Treat me like you did the night before

Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me want to cry

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
Let's all get up and dance to a song

Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you.
Though you've gone away this morning,
You'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right,
You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

You've tried before to leave me, 
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve,

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me,
If you leave me 

I will follow I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
'Cause I could't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

If you leave me 
I will follow I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
'Cause I could't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

Some think that happiness is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
Child-like
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some think that happiness is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, ooh
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with youWhat goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind 

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why 

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind 

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart? 

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why 

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
In your mind
In your mind
Oh, komm, doch. Komm zu mir.

Oh, komm, doch. Komm zu mir.

Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies)
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
Loving you
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for
The one who waits behind
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on
I must be by his side

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, hi
Goodbye
They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA,

All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 

Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 

Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 

Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again. 

They're really rocking in Boston,

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright

They say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me
And they say that eveyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me

Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well they're the ugly duckling, the little black sheep, and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me

Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well they're the ugly duckling, the little black sheep, and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me.
It's all too much, it's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much, it's too much

Too much, too much, too much
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got time
Oh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'
Uh huh, uh huh

Baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
Ye, baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Uh huh
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
Uh huh, uh huh

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzie,
The way you rock'n'roll.
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzie,
When we do the stroll.

Love me fore I grow too old.

Put your little hand in mine.

You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin',
I sure do wish you were mine.

Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "Hello".

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane!
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much, it's too much
Too much too much too much

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Free

Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe

It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.

So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show,
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go.

Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

I don't really like to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along

So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, you won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
Cause I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Cause money can't buy me love
Oh, can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love, no
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever had.

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,

That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

I can't believe it's happened to me.
I can't conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.
(Wilkin/Westberry)

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand

Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
Oh how you can hurt me
I just don't understand.
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking.

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner 
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.
Yeah
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

Gonna tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm gonna do

If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

Oh, yeah

Gonna tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm gonna do

If you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you.
Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus]
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

[Chorus]

In a couple of years they have built 
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Chorus]

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he's a singer with the band

[Chorus]

And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care
Listen do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell woh woh woh closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you oo
I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows just we two
Listen do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell woh woh woh closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you oo
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah,
Someday I'm going to make her mine.
I got something to say that might cause you pain,
If I catch you talking to that boy again,

I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Because I told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Well, it's the second time, I've caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin,
I think I'll let you down.
Let you down and leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Ev'rybody's green,
'cause I'm the one, who won your love,
But if it's seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face.
So please listen to me, if you want to stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind.

I know I'll let you down,
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that.
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of light are ringing
Through my open views inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe

Is bringing her down yeah.
For she would never be free
When I was around.

She's got a ticket to ride,

She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.

My baby don't care, my baby don't care.
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.
My baby don't care, my baby don't care.
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you

My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
I want a love that's right 
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl 
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm telling you

You know you pick me up 
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say 
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather 
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

Anna,
You come and ask me, girl,
To set you free, girl,
You say he loves you more than me,
So I will set you free,
Go with him.
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',
Go with him.

All of my life,
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.

Anna,
Just one more thing, girl.
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',
Go with him.

All of my life,
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.
As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' there are all shook up
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Oh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, girl
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Ooh I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
is not enough to show I care

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

Sexy Sadie, what have you done
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, ooh, what have you done

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you broke the rules

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along and turned on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, ooh, how did you know

Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you'll get yours yet

We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie
Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart

But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do, can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you  (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true  (cheat, cheat)

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you, don't leave me all alone
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door
Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me

Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
With each other
Silly girl

Hold you're hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear.
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
I got something to say that might cause you pain,
If I catch you talking to that boy again,
I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Because I told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Well, it's the second time, I've caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin,
I think I'll let you down.
Let you down and leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Everybody's green,
'Cause I'm the one, who won your love,
But if they'd seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face.

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind.
I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that. You can't do that.
You can't do that. You can't do that.
You can't do that. You can't do that.

Everybody's green,
'Cause I'm the one, who won your love,
But if they'd seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face.

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind.
I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that.
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh
My baby says she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

I said I'm traveling on the one after 909 
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

I said I'm traveling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

I said we're traveling on the one after 9 0,
I said we're traveling on the one after 9 0,
I said we're traveling on the one after 909.
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
All through' the day

Boy, you gotta carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitation
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you gotta carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you gotta carry that weight
You're gonna carry that weight along time
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride

Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage on the
Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forever more
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Hoo!
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
The world is treating me bad Misery
I'm the kind of guy,
Who never used to cry,
The world is treatin' me bad Misery

I've lost her now for sure,
I won't see her no more,
It's gonna be a drag Misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see,
Without her I will be in misery (oh oh oh)
In misery (ooh ee ooh ooh)
My misery (la la la la la la)
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
I'll never do you no harm, no harm

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said
Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel like I'm sad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born


She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right
Everything was right

I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right
Everything was right

I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it is to be sad
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl, girl

When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, oo, oo, oo
Girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Girl
It feels so right now, hold me tight,
Tell me I'm the only one,
And then I might,
Never be the lonely on

So hold me tight, to-night, to-night,

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
Would it be too much to ask you,
What you're doing to me?

You got me running and there's no fun in it,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you,
Wond'ring what you're gonna do,
Should you need a love that's true,
It's me.

Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?

What you're doing to me.
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
In your mind
In your mind
We've been friends for oh, so long 
I let you share what's mine 
But when you mess with the boy I love 
It's time to draw the line 
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by 
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time 
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by 
Girl, you get it through your head 
That boy is mine 
I don't mind when you lend my clothes 
My jewelry and such 
But, honey, let's get something straight
There's one thing you don't touch 
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby 
Girl, you get it through your head 
That boy is mine 
Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by 
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time 
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by 
Girl, you get it through your head

I ain't gonna tell you twice 
(Keep your hands off my) 
He's mine (bay-ee-a-by) 
Yay, yay, yeah, he's mine 
(Keep your hands off my) 
You better watch yourself, now (bay-ee-a-by)

Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home, yeah
That's all I gotta do.

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do

The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissing you

Oh, you just gotta call on me
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Why don't we do it in the road?

If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you
That when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multi-colored mirrors on his hobnail boots.

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.

A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust.

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Well don't you know that happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, (is a warm gun, yeah).
My tears are fallin' cause you've taken her away
And through it really hurts me so
There's something that I gotta say 
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Oh take good care of my baby, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby

She said "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said "Who put all those things in your hair
Things that ake me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

She said "You don't understand what I said"
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right"

I said "Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

She said "You don't understand what I said"
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong

'cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead..."
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wond'ring what you're gonna do
Should you need a love that's true
It's me

Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl

What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round, ah

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high, ah

Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue, ah

Ah
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you...

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
Sheepdog, standing in the rain
Bullfrog, doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile
Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Hey hey

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ha ha ha ha
Quiet, quiet (ok)
Quiet
Hey, bulldog, hey bulldog
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if I'm part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.

Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee.

I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you

You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go

Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go

Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Mr. Moonlight 
You came to me 
One summer night

Because we love you 
Mr. Moonlight

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you lost your love,
When I saw her yesterday.
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind.
She said to let you know
You're not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.

And now it's up to you,
I think it's only fair,
Pride can hurt you, too,
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that, 
You know you sho-o-ould
Be Glad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
You say it's your birthday
It's my birthday too--yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you.

Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party.

I would like you to dance, Birthday
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance, Birthday
I would like you to dance, Birthday
Dance

You say it's your birthday
Well it's my birthday too, yeah
You say it's your birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you.
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him".

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill? [x3]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote them like that

If you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
The just play it like that

And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
What words I pair
Or if my hair is brown
'Cause it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dull and out of key
You're correct
'Cause there's nobody there

And it's only there's no one there
Since she's been gone 
I want no one 
To talk to me 
It's not the same 
But I'm to blame 
It's plain to see 

So go away and leave me alone 
Don't bother me 

I can't believe 
That she would leave 
Me on my own 
It's just not right
Where every night 
I'm all alone 

I've got no time for you right now 
Don't bother me 

I know I'll never be the same 
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be 
The only girl for me 

But till she's here 
Please don't come near 
Just stay away 
I'll let you know 
When she's come home 
Till that the day 

Don't come around leave me alone 
Don't bother me 

I've got no time for you right now 
Don't bother me 

I know I'll never be the same 
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be 
The only girl for me 

But till she's here 
Please don't come near 
Just stay away 
I'll let you know 
When she's come home 
Till that the day 

Don't come around leave me alone 
Don't bother me 
Don't bother me 
Don't bother me
Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay
If the rain comes 
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines 
They slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you 
That when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever

P.S. I love you, you, you, you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do love
P.S. I love you, you, you, you

As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you, you, you, you

As I write this letter (oh)
Send my love to you (you know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always be in love with you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do love
P.S. I love you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I love you
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a'ticking,
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving,
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight,
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you,
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash,
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said, "That's alright, I'm waiting here,
Just waiting to hear from you"

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry
You say you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen the seven wonders
And you bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down
You may be awoken
I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home

Come on, out my way,
'Cause I'm gonna see my baby today,
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say, to her

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home

Come on, if you please,
I've got no time for trivialities,
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me, tonight

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home

When I'm getting home tonight, I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home,
I bet I'll love her more,
Till I walk out that door, again

Come on, let me through,
I've got so many things, I got to do,
I've got no business being here with you, this way

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Or I'll get a plan

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all the things you see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to
If you want it 
Here it is, 
Come and get it. 
Make your mind up fast. 

If you want it 
Anytime I can give it 
But you better hurry
Cause it may not last. 

Did I hear you say 
That there must be a catch 
Will you walk away 
From a fool and his money 

If you want it, 
Here it is, 
Come and get it, 
But you better hurry
Cause it's going fast. 

If you want it 
Here it is, 
Come and get it, 
Make your mind up fast. 

If you want it 
Anytime I can give it, 
But you'd better hurry
Cause it may not last. 

Did I hear you say 
That there must be a catch 
Will you walk away 
From a fool and his money
Sonny, if you want it, 
Here it is, 
Come and get it 
But you'd better hurry
Cause it's going fast. 
You'd better hurry
Cause it's going fast. 

Fool and his money. 

Sonny, if you want it, 
Here it is, 
Come and get it, 
But you'd better hurry
Cause it's going fast, 
You'd better hurry
Cause it's going fast, 
You'd better hurry
Cause it's going fast.
I tried to find out 
What love is all about, 
And every day 
It sure lets out. 
I see my baby 
I get week in my knees. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
My pappie told me 
There'd be times like these. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

We meet the gang 
And go to rocking Joes. 
The cats are something 
On the heels and toes. 
I grab my baby, 
Tried to give her a squeeze. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
Why must she be 
Such a doggone tease? 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I beg her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees, yeah. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I'm begging her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some of your loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees
Oh! Darling, please believe me

Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.

Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me.

You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same old thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down, wow
Baby I'm down

Oh baby, you know I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh yes, I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down on the ground (I'm really down)
Ah, Down (I'm really down)

Well, baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby, baby, baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down, down, down
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share 
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there, with our love, with our love
We could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking
About the love that's gone so cold
And the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
Well a-when the saints go marching in, 
When the saints go marching in

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies)
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you

Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' there are all shook up
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl
In my dreams

Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
Oh, like dreamers do

Until we kissed
I never knew the
Thrills that could be tasted
Until we kissed
I never knew the
Years that I had wasted

But now I know I was
Waiting for you to come by
I was waiting, girl
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin
Darling, where have
You been all my life

This took so long to begin
Darling, where have
You been all my life

Oh, where you been
Where you been
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
You've got to go back
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown call to say
You can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said
Say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said
She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said we wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
we all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
we'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright alright

You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
we all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know know it's gonna be alright
Alright slright
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

Better better better better better better, oh

Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is

In spite of you, it's true

I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say
To her.

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
When I'm getting home tonight, I'm gonna
Hold her tight.
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home,

Till I walk out that door
Again.

Come on, let me through,
I've got so many things, I've got to do,
I've got no business being here with you
This way.

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,

When I get home - yeah.
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows.

Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through the glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through the glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me.

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion.
Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down

Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Though you're gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
You back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I'll admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

I'll admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
Each time I look into your eyes 
I see that there a heaven lies 
And as I look 
I see the love of the loved. 

Someday they'll see that from the start 
My place has been deep in your heart. 
And in your heart 
I see the love of the loved. 

Though I said it all before 
I will say it more and more, 
Now that I'm really sure 
You love me. 

And I know that from today 
I'll see it in the way 
That you look at me 
And say ah you love me. 

So let it rain, I'll never care? 
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there. 
And when I'm there 
I see the love of the loved.

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and look so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Man, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well, he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well, this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
He took your canary and he fed it to the neighbors cat
He gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight 

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
 
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot 
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot 

[Chorus:]

A day or two ago, the story I must tell 
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away 

[Chorus:]

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead 

[Chorus:]
I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows.

Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through the glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through the glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me.

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion.
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in 
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these daya are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh.

That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along

So let me introduce to you the one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Billy Shears
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus
Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige
Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzie,
The way you rock'n'roll.
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzie,
When we do the stroll.

Girl, you look so fine.
You're just a-rockin' and.a-rollin',

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.
I'm crying.

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come.
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday.
Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long.
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.

Mister City Policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row.
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run.
I'm crying, I'm crying.
I'm crying, I'm crying.

Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye.
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess,
Boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down.
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun.
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain.
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob.

Expert textpert choking smokers,
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty,
See how they snide.
I'm crying.

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what is more, it's true
Yes it is

Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies). 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.
Yes it's so hard loving you.
Loving you.
Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he's a singer with the band

Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on

And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you.

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
Ring my friend, I said you call Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man,
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert

If you're down he'll pick you up, Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, he's a man you must believe,
Helping everyone in need
No one can succeed like Doctor Robert

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you, Doctor Robert

My friend works for the national health, Doctor Robert
Don't pay money just to see yourself with Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man,
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you, Doctor Robert
I think I'm gonna be sad,
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad,
I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye,
She ought to think twice,
She ought to do right by me
She said that living with me,
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Ah, she's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care

My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
Though you've gone away this morning,
You'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right,
You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
Cause you like me too much and I like you.

You've tried before to leave me, 
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve,

You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
Cause you like me too much and I like you.
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me,
If you leave me 

I will follow I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
Cause I couldn't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
Cause you like me too much and I like you.

If you leave me 
I will follow I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
Cause I couldn't really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
Cause you like me too much and I like you,
Cause you like me too much and I like you.

If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl, girl

When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, oo, oo, oo
Girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Girl
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia
Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Hum hum hum hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia, Julia, Julia
The best things in life are free

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
(Kesler/Feathers)

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget.
Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Thank you girl for loving me 
The way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right

She eating twelve chapattis and cream,
She tastes as Mongolian lamb, 
She coming from out of Bahran.

If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you 

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only 
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me 

The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me 

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so 
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me

Like a rolling stone
A like a rolling stone
Like the FBI and the CIA
And the BBC, BB King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby
Dig it, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you

I've got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh so true

I've got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied (oh)

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everything's the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
It's just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

You don't realize how much I need you,
Love you all the time
And never leave you.
Please come on back to me.
I'm lonely as can be.
I need you.
Said you had a thing or two to tell me.
How was I to know
You would upset me?
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me you don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you,
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you,
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

I need you
I need you
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round, oh oh oh, round round round round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round round round round, oh
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.

The King of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the Queen
The Queen was in the parlor
Playing piano for the children of the King.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The King was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The Queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The Dutchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The Duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh.

She's old enough to know better
Cry baby cry
Cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR, yeah

Been away so long I early knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home

Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the USSR
Hey, you don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR
Oh, let me tell you honey
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
Hey! We are following the footsteps of those who've gone before and we'll all be reunited on that new and sunlit shore.

Oh, when the saints go marching in, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the saints go marching in.

And when the sun refuse to shine, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the sun refuse to shine.

Oh, when the trumpet sound its call, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the trumpet sounds that call.

Oh, when the new world is revealed, [Repeat] oh, Lord, I want to be in that number when the new world is revealed.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely,
Baby take a chance with me.

If you want someone
To make you feel so fine,
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine,
So come, come on, come on.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?

You're the only one,
Don't run and hide,
Just come on, come on,
So come on, come on, come on.
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about,
I feel good, in a special way.
I'm in love and it's a sunny day.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
We take a walk, the sun is shining down,
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree,
I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
Oh Carol, don't let him 
Steal your heart away 
Well I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day

Well come into my machine 
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway 
Not too long a ride
You take your car along 
And you park it outside 
A little cutie takes your hat 
And you can thank her, ma'am
'Cause every time you're gonna drive 
You find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him 
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day Auw

Well if you want to hear some music 
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you 
'Cause they play so loud 
While the music will treat you 
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance 
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
'Cause you dance so good
Don't let him 
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 
Well I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes you all night and day

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels 
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without traveling 
See all without looking
Do all without doing
There, there's a place
Where I can go 
When I feel low 
When I feel blue 
And it's my mind 
And there's time 
When I'm alone 
I think of you 
The things you do 
Go round my head 
The things you've said 

Like I love only you 
In my mind there's no sorrow 
Don't you know that it's so 
There'll be no sad tomorrow 
Don't you know that it's so 

There, there's a place
Where I can go 
When I feel low 
When I feel blue 
And it's my mind 
And there's time 
When I'm alone

I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now

There is one thing I'm sure of,
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah

And you know the things she does,
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born. 

I said "Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born." 

She said "you don't understand what I said"
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right 

I said "Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born." 

She said "you don't understand what I said"
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right 

I said "Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born." 

She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...

Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Nature's son.
I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed 
I'm looking through you, you're not the same 

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound differnt, I've learned the game.
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Three cool cats, 
Three cool cats 
Are coming up in a beat up car, 
Spitting up a lift of candy bar 
Talking on about how sharp they are. 
Three cool cats. 

Three cool chicks 
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips, 
Splitting up a bag of potatoe chips 
I think cool cats really did flip. 
Three cool chicks

He said: man look at that.

Angels from up above 
And three cool cats

But three cool chicks 
Made three fools out of 
Three cool cats. 
Three cool cats.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better

Sunrise doesn't last all morning, 
A cloudburst doesn't last all day. 
Seems my love is up 
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

Sunset doesn't last all evening, 
A mind can blow those clouds away. 
After all this my love is up 
And must be leaving. 
It has not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

All things must pass 
None of life's strings can last. 
So I must be on my way, 
Face another day. 

Darkness only stays at nighttime, 
In the morning it will fade away. 
Daylight is good 
At arriving at the right time. 
It's not always 
Will to be this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 
All things must pass, 
All things must pass away.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't

She don't give boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye

She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as loving
Don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents

Only ever has to give me

She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman, she's a woman
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, you won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse,
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt,
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat the bacon

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to-- I will.

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"

I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"

It's not the first time that it's happened to me,
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind

So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah

Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee.
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
Led by the moonlight have all passed away.

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while I woo the with soft melody.
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,

Beautiful dreamer awake unto me.
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei,
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea,
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,

Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life-- I love you more
Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Thank you girl for loving me 
The way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you don't regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! Girl![Was she]

When I think of all the times I've tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I don't know why.
Ah, girl! Girl! Girl!

She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, cool, cool, cool. Girl! Girl!
Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!
You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
But I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
This dog is gonna get you 
If you don't leave her alone. 

Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
On the top of your head. 
That child is gonna miss you, 
You gonna wish that you were dead. 
If you don't leave my kitten all alone. 
Well I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
On the top of your head. 
That girl is gonna miss you, 
You gonna wish that you were dead.

Well I told you, big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

Hey hey you better leave, you better leave, 
You better leave, yeah you better leave, 
You better leave, oh you got to leave...
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I call her on the telephone
She says: baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her
But she only thinks of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him

Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Oh how long it will take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

(Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain)

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive.
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive.
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door.
I don't hear it,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a'ticking,
On the mantel shelf.
See the hands a'moving,
But I'm by myself.
I wonder where you are tonight,
And why I'm by myself.
I don't see you,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.

I'm sorry that I doubted you,
I was so unfair.
You were in a car crash,
And you lost your hair.
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two.
I said, "That's alright, I'm waiting here,
Just waiting to hear from you".

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry.
Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around - it's past
You don't time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before I'm dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
And what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill your head with all the things you see

I'll make love to you
If you want me too
I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus

You let your knickers down

Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob Goo Goo Goo g' joob

(Oh I'm tired, servicible villain
Set you down father, rest you)
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She(we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone.
"Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"

She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years
Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the Motortrade

She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)

Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years
She's leaving home, bye, bye
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place, there's a place, there's a place, there's a place
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Ooh baby
Say you're driving me insane
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your lover man

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl I want to marry you

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine.
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
She looks as an African Queen

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her
But she only thinks of him

Till she sees the mistake she has made?

Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why
You don't realize how much I need you,
Love you all the time
And never leave you.
Please come on back to me.
I'm lonely as can be.
I need you.
Said you had a thing or two to tell me.
How was I to know
You would upset me?
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me you don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you,
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you,
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

I need you
I need you
If you leave me, baby
I don't know what Ill do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Oh, if you want me, baby

You just can't move me

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Shine until tomorrow, let it be

If I could get my way

But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away

Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

The Magical Mystery Tour
Is coming to take you away
Coming to take you away

The Magical Mystery Tour
Is dying to take you away
Dying to take you away
Take you today
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

(Walk, walk cat, walk)
(Go, Johnny, go)
(Same old tale of blues)
(Elmo James got nothing on this, baby)

I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I really love you
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, you won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

The leaves of brown 
Came tumbling down, 
Remember in September in the rain. 
The sun went out 
Just like a light, 
Remember in September in the rain. 

To every word 
Of love I heard you whisper 
The raindrops seems 
To play a sweet refrain. 
Thought it's spring, 
To me it's still September, 
Oh that September in the rain. 

To every word 
Of love I heard you whisper 
The raindrops seems 
To play a sweet refrain. 
Thought it's spring, 
To me it's still September, 
Oh that September in the rain. 
I said I said it's September in the rain. 
Ah September in the rain.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly blackbird fly

All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely

You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
You back where you belong

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine, 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

I know what it is to be sad."
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said "Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said "You don't understand what I said."
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right."

I said "Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said "You don't understand what I said."
I said "No, no, no, you're wrong

I know what it's like to be dead..."
We were strolling along (twist and shout!) 
On Moonlight Bay (woo hoo!) 
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!) 
You said you'd stay 
You have broken my heart (oh, twist and shout!) 
So don't go away 
With your short and hairy legs 
On Moonlight Bay 
On Moonlight Bay
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
Good morning, good morning
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
It was twenty years ago today, 
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play, 
They've been going in and out of style 
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile. 

So may I introduce to you 
The act you've known for all these years 
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

It's certainly a thrill 
You're such a lovely audience 
We'd like to take you home with us 
We'd love to take you home 

I don't really like to stop the show 
But I thought that you might like to know 
That the singer's going to sing a song 
And he wants you all to sing along 

So let me introduce to you 
The one and only Billy Shears 
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train

And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.

All these years I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you. 

Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year,
Ev'rybody let their hair down,
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah. 

[Oh my soul... so odd.]
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes"
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Then we'll have some fun 
When you're mine, all mine, 
So come, come on, come on. 

Little child, little child, 
Little child, won't you dance with me? 
I'm so sad and lonely, 
Baby take a chance with me. 

When you're by my side, 
You're the only one, 
Don't you run and hide, 
Just come on, come on, 
So come on, come on, come on. 

Little child, little child, 
Little child, won't you dance with me? 
I'm so sad and lonely, 
Baby take a chance with me. 
Baby take a chance with me. 
Baby take a chance with me.
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Sexy Sadie, what have you done
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, ooh, what have you done

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you broke the rules

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along and turned on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, ooh, how did you know

Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you'll get yours yet

We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie
A taste of honey,
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Do do do
Do do do

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back for the honey and you

Do do do
Do do do

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
That taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back (he'll come back)
For the honey (for the honey)
And you
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I dream of your first kiss, and then, 
I feel upon my lips again, 
A taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I will return, yes I will return, 
I'll come back for the honey and you. 

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart, 
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart, 
That taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I will return, yes I will return, 
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
We hope you will enjoy the show,
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
Sit back and let the evening go.
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
It's wonderful to be here,
It's certainly a thrill.
You're such a lovely audience,
We'd like to take you home with us,
We'd love to take you home. 

I don't really want to stop the show,
But I thought that you might like to know,
That the singer's going to sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along.
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 

Billy Shears
We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me want to cry

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

A friend says a love is never true
And you know that this don't apply on you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
When she says she loves you that means a lot

Love can be deep inside, love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel when it's real
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know your love is all you got

At touch can mean so much when it's all you got
When she says she loves you that means a lot
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day
I remember you-ooh
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you-ooh
You're the one who said I love you, too
Yes, I do, didn'tcha know?

I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Just like the rain out of the blue-ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
I want to be your lover baby,

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge, really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know, and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You shout aloud

You'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are,
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart

But you'll have to have them all pulled out

Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out

Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home. 
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home. 
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back Jojo, go home

Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged

But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back Loretta, go home

Get back, get back

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show

There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now

There is one thing I'm sure of,
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,

Well see her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially,
Ain't she sweet?

Oh ain't she nice,
Well look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially,
Ain't she nice?

Just cast an eye
In her direction.
Oh me oh my,
Ain't that perfection?

Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially,
Ain't she sweet?

Oh ain't she sweet,
Well see her walking down that street.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about,
I feel good, in a special way.
I'm in love and it's a sunny day.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
We take a walk, the sun is shining down,
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree,
I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,

I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be, 
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave 
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Who looked like you.

Oh yeah, oh yeah.

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Oh no
Oh no no no

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

No reply, no reply
Honey pie, honey pie 
Honey pie, honey pie 
Honey pie, honey pie 
Honey pie, honey pie 
I love you honey pie
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you 

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through
Your window
I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place

If I were you, I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before, when you gave me no reply

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.
Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home.
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home.
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Whenever I want you around yeh 
All I gotta do 
Is call you on the phone 
And you'll come running home 
Yeh that's all I gotta do 

And when I, I want to kiss you yeh 
All I gotta do 
Is whisper in your ear 
The words you want to hear 
And I'll be kissing you 

And the same goes for me 
Whenever you want me at all 
I'll be here yes I will 
Whenever you can 
You just gotta call on me, yeh 
You just gotta call on me 

And when I, I want to kiss you, yeh 
All I got to do 
Is call you on the phone 
And you'll come running how 
Yeh, that's all I gotta do 

And the same goes for me 
Whenever you want me at all 
I'll be here yes I will 
Whenever you can 
You just gotta call on me, yeh 
You just gotta call on me 
Oh, you just gotta call on me 
Ooh, ooh
Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the color of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right

Some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

Some other guy, is makin' me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is makin' my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
I'm a-talkin' to you, right now
Ow!

Hey! Yeah!
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine.
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three.
Would you lock the door.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.
You'll be older too,
And if I say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride,
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four.
Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck&Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Your's sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know

Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
The things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl,
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, ooh
You never wear a stitch of lace
And powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
Oh please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

I kinda like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

Oh promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you?

A lot of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

No promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are
Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to-- I will.

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.
As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever

P.S. I love you, you, you, you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do love
P.S. I love you, you, you, you

As I write this letter, send my love to you
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you, you, you, you

As I write this letter (oh)
Send my love to you (you know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always be in love with you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do love
P.S. I love you, you, you, you
You, you, you

Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows.

Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through the glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through the glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me.

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion.
[Instrumental]

Being here alone tonight with you,
It feels so right now.

Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.

The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got time
Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll

Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)

Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say-yi-yay

She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
And now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind

She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
you know you should be glad
With a love like that
you know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh her lips are really thrilling

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt em
She won't desert me
Listen can't you see

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, no this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Nature's son.
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo, go home

Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta, go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, get back
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
I'm finding out what love is all about
Every day at three when school lets out
I'll see my baby I get weak in the knees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Why must she be such a dog gone tease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

We meet the gang and go to Rockin' Joe's
The cats are stomping on their heels and toes
I grab my baby try and give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
My daddy told me there be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spends my money then she treats me cruel
Im beggin' for her kisses on bended knees
Give me some lovin' baby please please please

I keep trying hard to make her mine
Some day the wind will blow the sun will shine
Until the time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She lock my heart and throw away the key
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spends my money then she treats me cruel
I'm beggin' for her kisses on bended knees
Give me some lovin' please please please
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out now
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

And I found out

Day tripper, day tripper, yeah

What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?

The world is treating me bad Misery
I'm the kind of guy,
Who never used to cry,
The world is treatin' me bad Misery

I've lost her now for sure,
I won't see her no more,
It's gonna be a drag Misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see,
Without her I will be in misery (oh oh oh)
In misery (ooh ee ooh ooh)
My misery (la la la la la la)
I'm looking through you, 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you, 
What did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed.
I'm looking through you, you're not the same. 

Your lips are moving, 
I cannot hear.
Your voice is soothing, 
But the words aren't clear.
You don't sound different, 
I've learned the game.
I'm looking through you, 
You're not the same. 

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

You're thinking of me, 
The same old way.
You were above me, 
But not today.
The only difference is you're down there.
I'm looking through you, 
Any other way. 

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

I'm looking through you, 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you, 
What did I know?
You don't look different, 
But you have changed.
I'm looking through you, 
You're not the same!
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Here comes the sun king

Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Silver hammer man

I want to be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And baby I love you

I told a girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Baby you can drive my car

Baby you can drive my car

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.

Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short, and there's no time

Well, come on pretty baby won't you walk with me
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try and save our romance
Slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving
Gimme little loving
Ow, if you want our love to last

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what're you trying to do
You better slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving
Gimme little loving
Brrr, if you want our love to last

Well, you know that I love you, tell the world I do
Come on pretty baby, why can't you be true
I need you badly, baby, oh so bad
The best little woman I ever had
Slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving
Gimme little loving
Ow, if you want our love to last
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you.

Rodney Burke: That was a, a Little Richard number that the boys rather like and hope you liked it, "Ooh! My Soul." And, ooh, my arms! We've, we've just flown in to Manchester here from London to record this show. Ha, ha. Well, it's, ha, ha, it's good to see you again, fellers, in these, er, foreign parts. How are you?
John: Oh, great!
George: Very well, thank you.
Ringo: Oh, great, yeah, it's just fine.
Paul: Yeah.
Rodney: Well, what are you doing at the moment, by the way?
George: Ah, we're playing in Liverpool at the moment and we've never been there months, you see, so it's--
Ringo: It's good to be back.
Paul Yeah, it's great!
Rodney: Anybody over there like a request that you can do right now?
George: Well, we'll do a request for everybody.
Paul: Yeah.
Rodney: Good, what do you suggest?
George: Er, "Don't Ever Change," one of the oldies.

If you let me take your heart, I will prove to you
We will never be apart, if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me, I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realize now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Lyrics
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
And they ain't the kind that you can see.
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me. Yeah!
 
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains,
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free.
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be. Yeah!
 
Now believe me when I tell you I think you're fine.
I'd like to hold you, but, darling, I'm imprisoned by these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
And they ain't the kind that you can see.
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, Yeah!
 
I wanna tell you pretty baby, your lips look sweet.

Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Silver hammer man
I'm gonna tell aunt Mary 'bout uncle John
He said he had the misery but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby 
Some fun tonight

I saw uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby
Some fun tonight

Well, long tall Sally's built pretty sweet
She got everything that uncle John needs
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby
Some fun tonight

Well, we're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight, oh
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun, yeah, yeah, yeah

We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun
Some fun tonight
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.

The King of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the Queen
The Queen was in the parlor
Playing piano for the children of the King.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The King was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The Queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The Dutchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The Duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh.

She's old enough to know better
Cry baby cry
Cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.
Love, Love, Love.
Love, Love, Love.
Love, Love, Love.
There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game.
It's easy.
Nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time.
It's easy.

[Chorus: x2]
All you need is love.
All you need is love.
All you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.

[Chorus: x2]

Nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.
It's easy.

[Chorus: x2]

All you need is love (All together, now!)
All you need is love (Everybody!)
All you need is love, love. Love is all you need (love is all you need).
We were talking, about the space between us all
And the people, who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking, about the love we all could share 
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there, with our love
With our love we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking, about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself 
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

Do, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out, 'cause here she comes

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again, yeah, yeah

Well do you, don't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Look out, helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes, she is
Yes, she is
Coming down fast

(I've got blisters on my fingers)
