Lyrics
Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee
My Poppa said, son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me
'Cause he'll get you, 'cause he'll get you now, now

I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou

Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou.

I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
This state I'm in
A place I've never been
I'm dying to meet you here

Come break this skin
I'll let you sink right in
And show you everything
See you in hell
See you in hell

We'll gather around the fire
And I will lead the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell

Come break, my spell
Well down the wishing well
We'll find some time to kill

I'll be, right there
The buzz inside your head
The whole electric chair
See you in hell

We'll gather round the fire
And I don't need the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell
A heart of gold
But it lost it's pride
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
I see your face
In another light

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

A simple man
And his blushing bride
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Intravenous
Intertwined
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Hearts gone cold
Your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Oh you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waiting and I wait at the longest night
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline

I was down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing last
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, they have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

Finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Heart across a heart that beats it's best

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's
Been mine, all mine

Ain't no way, DOA
Ain't no way, DOA

It's a shame we have to disappear
No ones getting out of here, alive

This time
This time
This time
I'm called a cow
I'm not about
To blow it now
For all the cows

It's funny how money allows all to browse
And be endowed
This wish is true it falls into pieces new
The cow is you

My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows, everything worn in
Like it's a friend

I said you're all a painted doll and it caused
The walls to fall
How far is he? 
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be
Lately, I've been
Livin' in my head
The rest of me is dead,
I'm dying for truth.

Make me, believe,
No more left and right,
Come on take my side,
I'm fightin' for you,
I'm fightin' for you.

Pleased to meet you take my hand,
There is no way back from here,
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,
There is no way back from here,
But I don't care,
No way back from here

Wake me, I'm ready,
Somethin' don't seem right,
I was dreamin' and
I was talkin' to you,

Memory, mend me,
Know I've seen my share,
Things I can't repair,
I'm breakin' to you,
I'm breakin' to you.

Pleased to meet you take my hand,
There is no way back from here,
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,
There is no way back from here,
But I don't care,
No way back from, here.

Pleased to meet you say your prayers,
There is no way back from here,
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,
There is no way back from here,
But I don't care,
No way back from, here.
Disenchanted Lullaby
Sing me yours, I'll sing you mine
Sing with me now what's a boy to do?
What's a boy to do?
Sing along for yesterday
Sing along my soul today
Sing along another song for you
What's a boy to do?

I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter
No one has a fit like I do

I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter?
No one has a fit like I do
I'm the only one that's fits you

Whispering to pass the time
Whisper for the days gone by
Whisper with the voice inside of you
With this ring you will be mine
With this ring I'll multiply
With this ring surrendering to you
What's a boy to do?
He floats
Floats away
On the ground
He comes back down

She floats
Floats away
On the ground
She comes back down

They float
Float away
On the ground
They come back down

We float
Float away
On the ground
We come back down

That's not as big as
What's flown around here
Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it
I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may
The thought of being ousted comes and goes
When I think about it the wind blows
I hate it

Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around
I hate it

Good grief
Hello
I've waited here for you
Ever long
Tonight I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
Seda can you hear me
Do you know my face
Perfect like a circle
Gone without a trace

So long I have known you
Marks upon your skin
I can picture everything
Can you picture this

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All the secrets bare for the world to see

Who will stand before you
If you don't say my name
Safe to say we will never know
We are both the same

I don't mind
I can always find you
Waiting there for me

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All her secrets bare for the world to see

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
Seda doesn't care
She's just dyin' there
Seda doesn't care
She's just lyin' there
All the secrets bare for you and me
You and I were two old and tortured souls
Repaired by a love of broken things
In a life, just some bodies growing old
No fear of the end, of anything

We're just ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually

We got by, though we never needed much
A sliver of hope, no diamond rings
We got high, it was heaven it was hell
Flying over them, with broken wings

[Chorus]
We're just ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually
Oh, just two ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually

Our bones forever in stone
Monuments of life
To dust, as everything must
We fade away in time, oh

[Chorus]

Just two ordinary people you and me
Time will turn us into statues eventually
Burn all the candles out
Make a wish but not aloud
Relive the here and now
See you now and then
I'm a revolvin' door
I've seen it all before
I will begin again
But I can't start until I've seen you end

I took a look around
I believe that in these eyes
The treasure's all we've found
May be more than needed
Now that we're old and worn
A little ripped and torn
One day we'll be reborn
One day I will meet you up again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling

I'm feelin' out of luck
Maybe I just feel too much
That old familiar touch
Always stained my skin
The good in everyone
The ties we left undone
The heart that meets your blood
All the things bring me 'round again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
Oh yeah
Hey
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
These notes are marked return to sender
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh

These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm gettin' further from myself
One thins is always true, how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
I'm done resenting you, you represented me so well
And this I promise you

How could I end up in this hands of someone else?
These notes are marked return to sender
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh

These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm gettin' further from myself
One thins is always true, how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
Lately I'm getting better
Wish I could stay sick with you
But there's too many egos left to bruise
Call it sin
You can call it whatever
Eating deep inside of you
Well if it were me it's all I'd ever do

Steal me now and forever
I'll steal something good for you
The criminal in me is no-one new

Till you find something better
When there's nothing left to use
And everything starts going down on you

I'm the generator
Firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it

Send me out on a tether
Swing it round
I'll spin your noose
You let it down
I'll hang around with you
Till you find someone better
When there's no-one left to lose
Everyone keeps going down

I'm the generator
Firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it
All my life I've been searching for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nuthin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, and it's takin'away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I fear the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Calm down, don't you resist
Your such a delicate rist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip

Will I find something in there,
To give it just what it needs
Another reason to bleed
One by one, Hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus]
One by one, Hidden up my sleeve
[Repeat: x3]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but, I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Will I find the believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over, down on my knees

If I get any closer, I
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothin' to hide

[Chorus]

All my life I've been searching for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, and it's takin'away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Done, done; on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one

Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
[Repeat: x2]
Done, done, and I'm on the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next

[Repeat: x3]
Done, done; on the next one

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
Done, done; on the next one

Done, I'm done, I'm on to the next
Every night my dream?s the same
Same old city with a different name
They?re not coming to take me away!
I don?t know why, but I know I can?t stay
Yeah

There?s a weight that?s pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don?t know where and they don?t know when

It?s coming
When it?s coming
There?s a weight that?s pressing me down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don?t know where and they don?t know when

It?s coming
Or when
But it?s coming, keep the car running
There?s this fear I keep so deep
Knew it's name since before I can speak, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

They know my name I know them
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name but I don't understand
But they don?t know where, they don?t know when

It?s coming
Or when
Keeps me coming, keep the car running

Keep the car running

Keep the car running

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Chorus]

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

[Chorus]

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Chorus]

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
All my life I've been searching for something,
Something never comes, never leads to nothing,
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close,
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope.
All night long I dream of the day,
Then it comes around and it's taken away,
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most,
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost.

Come down, don't you resist,
You've such a delicate wrist.
And if I give it a twist,
Something to hold when I lose my grip.
Will I find something in the air,
To give me just what I need.
Another reason to bleed.
One by one hidden up my sleeve,
One by one hidden up my sleeve.

Hey, don't let it go to waste,
I love it but I hate the taste.
Weight keeping me down.

Will I find a believer,
Another one who believes,
Another one that deceives,
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer,
And if you open up wide.
If you let me inside,
On and on I got nothing to hide,
On and on i got nothing to hide.

Done, done onto the next one, done.
There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in Kashmir
All of your sound echoes in the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there
There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

Oh, I found the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing, and time will cling to
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there
There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me
Man watchin' video
The heart keeps on tickin'
He doesn't know why
He's just cattle for slaughter

The requiem

When the meaningful words
When they cease to function
When there's nothing to say
When will they start plotting against you

Only a hint of religion
I'm sensing spirits of depravity
The sound of breaking glass
This is the reflection
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah!

Beautiful prisoner, let it be dead
Promises made it certain to end
Voices and visions are locked in my head
I could sing for sorrow
All of the words that we damn never speak
All of our ghosts and secrets do keep
Gather them all we'll bury them deep
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, hey!

One for forever
One in your name
Once in your member
We're one in the same
One to forget but it always remains
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, yeah!
You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself
And you bleed and breath the air
And its on and on and on and on and on

I just kinda died for you
You just kinda stared at me
We will always have the chance
We can do this one more time

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

You believe there's somewhere else
Where it's easier than this
And you see outside yourself
And you buy the hole you'll fill
And it's on and on and on and on and on

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
On and on and on aurora
Wait for everyone
Wait till the last one's done

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

On and on and on and on...
There you go again
Putting words into my mouth
This one's for you to know
And for me to find out

All that trouble, and you on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
Stop, ask myself what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
Come on, tell me now what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?

I heard every word comin' from the 13th floor
Your song came along
And I heard the voices telling me to save yourself
I'll behave yourself

I stop, ask myself what did I do?
What can I do to preserve you?
Come on, tell me now, what can I do?
What can I do to conserve you?

Your name, year of fame
I could see the writing on the wall
Come on, flip a coin, bet it's going to tell you
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself

Your man, channelin', knowin' by the X on his hand
You raise, runaways singin' at the gate
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself

So here I go again
Putting words into your mouth
This one's for me to know
And for you to find out

All that trouble and I'm on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
All of your heroes, where are they now?

I'm lost, deliver me
I crossed the river finally
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight

God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight
Dear lover 
Do you remember? 
The sound of your laughter and demise 
And that was all 
I need to fall in love 

This matter 
It's something bigger
Anything ever graced my heart 
And that was all 
I could fall in love, with you 
And I can't stall this now 

Did you find some happiness with me? 
Now I know the way true love should be 

Dear lover 
Do you remember? 
The beats of my heart that I gave you 
And that was all 
I need to fall in love 

It shattered
Slipped through my fingers
Floated down safely into your hands 
And that was all 
I could fall in love...with you 
I can't stall this now 

Oh oh oh 

Did you find some happiness with me? 

Yea yea yea 
Yea yea yea yea
Hello 
I've waited here for you 
Everlong
Tonight 
I throw myself into 
And out of the red, out of her head she sang 

Come down 
And waste away with me 
Down with me 

Slow how 
You wanted it to be 
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang 

And I wonder 
When I sing along with you 
If everything could ever feel this real forever 
If anything could ever be this good again 

The only thing I'll ever ask of you 
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when 
She sang 

Breathe out 
So I could breathe you in 
Hold you in 

And now 
I know you've always been 
Out of your head, out of my head I sang 

And I wonder 
When I sing along with you 
If everything could ever feel this real forever 
If anything could ever be this good again 

The only thing I'll ever ask of you 
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when 
She sang 

And I wonder 
If everything could ever feel this real forever 
If anything could ever be this good again 

The only thing I'll ever ask of you 
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when 
She sang
I'm not around that much
Running exhausted and lost
If it could be undone
Will it have costed?
It's taught and lost

Blowing away we stray, wilted
Insuited, at fault
What if the day had stayed in bed
These baubles we've brought
At fault
After the bliss has long ended
This caution this fault
Give me a breeze that's long winded
Accosted adult arrested
I have spent a lifetime
Waiting for the chance
To save you my confession
Save the one last dance
The same old superstition
Haunt us now and then
I'm begging for ignition
To start it all again

We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
Breathe for me from now on
Breathe for me when I'm gone
Burn out beyond
Out beyond the sun

Will you still remember
There behind the skies
Walking on the embers
Standing in their light
The hardest part is knowing
Everything must die
The hardest part is waiting here
Waiting to collide

We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
Breathe for me from now on
Breathe for me when I'm gone
Burn out beyond
Out beyond the sun

Burn on, burn on
Calling to you
Burn on, burn on
Calling to you
Burn on, burn on

I'll never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
We'll never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
I'll take you out of the wishin' well
I thinkin' I have a plan
Go with your bad self
Why did you cheat yourself?
You think you're losing
China's not accusing
You never gonna take a hit on the head
Now if you don't care
Take a ride somewhere

Hey you got something
You gotta try and buy our soul
Hey you got something
It goes round and round again
Go, go, you should've never waste your lung
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go limo, go limo

I got you stuck in the habit trail
You've grown to lovin' this shit
Way out on a back shelf
Yeah you don't know what you've done
Look what you're doin'
Now mama says it's ruined
You've got a mollusk in the palm of your hand
So it's a bad smell
Your eyes wanna win

Hey you got something
You wanna try and buy our soul
Hey you got something
It goes round and round and round again
Go, go, you're never having to waste your lung
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go, go, whatever happened to Day-Glo Jones?
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go limo, go limo
If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me
Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon

You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's
Go, go

What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me but sure look good on you
You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's
Go, go!

Miss the misery
Gimme a reason for a change
Miss the misery
Gimme a reason to refrain
Miss your misery in a day
Miss your misery in a day
Come on and turn it on for me

Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Don't make this right
Don't make this right
Get in and let's
Go, go
The waves that silences break come again,
One by one
I lay awake and I count til I drown
Turn off the room, it's getting too loud, 
I know I don't have to say it,
Pick up and move and go find some new ground,
Somewhere I know I can make it

But I won't give up,
When I want it enough,
No I won't give up,
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
'Cause I've figured it out,
Here and the now, 
Takes me day by day

Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make eveything right,
Make me normal, from now on

Erased every one I've replaced
In the end, they're all gone,
The faces all fade as the time passes by
What could I do I was waiting for you,
Grown sick and tired of faking,
Give me those eyes when I give you the truth,
Finally here for the taking

But I won't give up,
When I want it enough,
No I won't give up,
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
Cause I've figured it out,
Here and the now, 
Takes me day by day

[Repeat: x2]
Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make eveything right,
Make me normal, from now on 

Figured it out,
Here and the now,
Takes me day by day

[Repeat: x2]
Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make everything right,
Make me normal, from now on 

Make me normal, from now on
Make me normal, from now on
Make me normal, from now on
Ahhhahhahhahh 
She came from Planet Claire
I knew she came from there
She drove a Plymouth Satellite
Faster than the speed of light
Planet Claire has pink air
All the trees are red
No one ever dies there
No one has a head 
Ahhhahhhahhahh 
Some say she's from Mars
Or one of the seven stars
That shine after 3:30 in the morning
Well she isn't 
Ahhhahhhahhahhahhahh

Breathe oh breathe now smother me
So clever me, I'm onto you
My oh my, now testify
I'm guilty by my clouds on you

Where you been?
How far'd you get?
I got this sin I saved for you
I don't need your remedy
I wanna be right
Sick of you

Sweet as torture at least we were alive
Cringe and burn [?] now mark my words and
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Cause it's mine

Open wide, my crucify
I wanna ride my lungs on you
Nervous we, oh jealousy
It's gonna be their debt to you
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time

Sweet as torture at least we were alive
Cringe and burn [?] now mark my words so
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Cause it's mine

Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time

Sweet as torture now mark my words and
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Cause it's mine
Ready aim fire

No one fuckin' around standing in the line
You gotta feel it right between the eyes
Time is runnin' out, time to do it right, now

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie

Let yourself go, let me test your fate
Make your head roll, make your legs shake
Dance to the sound of heartache

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie, oh

Fat fucking lie, get on your bikes and ride

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie, fat fucking lie

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day

When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Calm down don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve (one by one hidden up my sleeve)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide (on and on I've got nothing to hide)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Then I'm done done on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next

Done done on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next one
Done done on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Done done on to the next one
And I'm done and on to the next
Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms

Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon

Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Over and out

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean

But the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky
Yet the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky

You might think you know me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

You might think you own me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Buried my heart, cannot go this alone, oh no
Poison this house, god in the stone
Oh no, you don't

Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean

But the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky

You might think you owe me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

I might think you love me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Bring all your lies leave them deep in the dirt
Oh no, you don't
Pull down my eyes
Lay me deep in the earth
Oh no, you don't

Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean
What have we done with innocence
It disappeared with time it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten 
One in ten
One in ten

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends 
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

One Last thing before I quit
I never wanted anymore than I could fit
Into my head I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it

Still there is one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
(Fall in fall out)
These are my famous last words
My number's up bridges will burn
Oh won't you let me twist your fate
It's getting kinda late

And I don't wanna wait no more
Oh may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace
You passed your test of faith
Another time, another place, another line upon your face
Another in your wake
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flames
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Oh let me put you in your place
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but
Tell me what's in it for me

Tell me now what's in it for me
No one's getting this for free
So tell me now what's in it for me
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)

Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down

Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now
When I talk about it
It carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons
All renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

When I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew

But it's you I fell into

But it's you I fell into

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into
Oh mirror mirror
You're coming in clear
I'm finally somewhere in between
I'm impressed
What a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene

Will you resign to the latest design
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire
Or wonderful liar?
I think its time we all should come clean
Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?

God bless, what a sensitive mess
Yeah but things aren't always what they seem
Your teary eyes
Your famous disguise
Never knowing who to believe

See through
Yeah, but what do you do?
When you're just another aging drag queen?

Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?
Leading everything along
Never far from being wrong
Never mind these things at all
It's nothing
Couldn't find a way to you
Seems that's all I ever do
Turning up in black and blue
Rewarded

All the static we all left

Wait until the time has come
Figure that's where time comes from
Leaving all my senses numb
Is heaven
Lifted up the fay to seen
Anything could never be
Anything but play to me
In order

Take it back for them to keep
Fallen into something deep
Not that I had made that leap
Anointed
Where have all the wishes gone
Now that all of that is done
Wish I would've felt I've won
For once
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper One last thing before I quit!  
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!
I still remember every single word you said,
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this

I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the wide world riot
And hiding out
I'll be coming home next year

Into the sun we climb
Climbing our wings will burn white
Everyone strapped in tight
We'll ride it out
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No-one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

Into the night we shine
Lighting the way we glide by
Catch me if I get too high
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the whole world wind
Around and round
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till I fall down
No one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's all right up here
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's all right up here
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year
Goddamn this dusty room
This hazy afternoon
I'm breathing in this silence
Like never before

This feeling that I get
This one last cigarette
As I lay awake
And wait for you to come through the door

Oh maybe maybe maybe
I can share it with you
I behave I behave I behave
So I can share it with you

You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know

I am not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

We'll dream about somewhere
Our smoke will fill the air
As I lay awake and wait
For you to walk out that door
I can change I can change I can change
But who do you want me to be
I'm the same I'm the same I'm the same
Oh do you want me to be

You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know

I'm not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Goodbye Jimmy, farewell youth
I must be on my way I have had enough of you
I was a young man proud and true
Just a simple boy with nothing else to lose
Years that I've wasted these I owe you's
They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air you better save your breath
Say have you heard
Say have you heard
The poison in my heart voices in my head
Years that I've waited these I owe you's
I meant every word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
But it's only words
I meant every word
They're just fucking words
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward

Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
I'm molasses hung in rent
Read a sponsor one shot no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
As if you blame real and stagnate
Big shit no shit

Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Some try that hit beast and mud lead
Big shit no shit

Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
Big shit no duh

Right?
One shot nothing
Visiting is pretty
Visiting is good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother

This can be a secret
We can keep it good
Even all the ever wanting had a problem

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been far too long

Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking

Them balloons are pretty
Big and say they should
Ever fall to ground
Call the magic marker

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long

Minicyn is pretty
Minicyn is good
Seems that all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter
Ritalin is easy
Ritalin is good
Even all the ones
Who watered down the daughter

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long

Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking

He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him in
It's just a quiet room
And he's there

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played

He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He said nevermind
And no-one speaks

He thinks he drinks too much
Cos when he tells his too best friends
'I think I drink too much'
No-one speaks
No-one speaks
No-one speaks

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played

When he plays
No-one speaks
No-one speaks
When he plays
No-one speaks
He's there in case I wandered off
He's scared because I warned
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want

All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
Lately I've been measuring
Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin
Watch me spin

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones

All worn out and nothing fits
Brennivin and cigarettes
The more I give the less I get
But I'm all set
I'm all set

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones

Deep within this frame of mine
Heart of hearts a valentine
Tell my mom I'm doing fine
Doing fine
Doing fine

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Hey now don't make a sound
Say have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in it's place

A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singing in your name

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight
Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong just hangin' on
Even though, watched you come and go
How was I to know you'd steal the show?
One day I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call bet it all
Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong, just hangin' on
Even though, pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown, it heals the soul
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in shadows of them all
I'd stand, but they're much to tall
And I fall
February stars re floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Feed the lawn from the palms of their hands
Never holding, to a pole
Winnebago, we were one
Hold in wonder, spoke and wheel
She divorces, party zeal

Daddy loves little son, no demand
Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Crawl along, lookin' up 'til you standorld
Woe is me
The end is near, thought you'd never leave
Heart and teeth
Just to taste bittersweet
One last stain to get beneath the skin
Beneath the skin

The wish is drawn inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
No one lets everyone in

Me and you
Draw the line
Now it's time to move
Face to face
Damn the luck, blessed be
Heaven, what's come over me?

The wishes come inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in

No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
I should have known that it would end this way
I should have known there was no other way
Didn't hear your warning
Damn my heart gone deaf

I should have known, look at the shape you're in
I should have known, but I dove right in
One thing is for certain
As I'm standing here
I should have known

Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt

I should have known, I was inside of you
I should have known, there was that side of you
Came without a warning
Caught me unaware
I should have known, I've been here before
I should have known, don't want it anymore
One thing is for certain
I'm still standing here
I should have known

Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
I should have known
Maybe you was right
Didn't want a fight
I should have known
Couldn't read the signs
Couldn't see the light
I should have known
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave us all in debt
I should have known
Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms

Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon

Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Over and out

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
You know in all of the time that we've shared
I've never been so scared
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there
I wish I never had taken this dare
I wasn't quite prepared
Doll me up in my bad luck
Uh huh, ah
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there
I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the wide world riot
And hiding out
I'll be coming home next year

Into the sun we climb
Climbing our wings will burn white
Everyone strapped in tight
We'll ride it out
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No-one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

Into the night we shine
Lighting the way we glide by
Catch me if I get too high
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the whole world wind
Around and round
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till I fall down
No one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's all right up here
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No-one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

I'll be coming home next year
I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by
The diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
But is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
Hanging on this wire
Waiting for the day I have to choose
Cursed by love so dire
One more boy for hire
One more boy to lend a hand to you
But it is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
Of you
Of you

I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by
The diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
Is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
Of you
Hey I'm glad I caught you on the phone
Thirty hours until Im back home
Been hallucinating, me and Sean
Time to turn his headlamp on
Yeah who you running from?

Someone left their haircut on the lawn
Twenty hours until I'm back home
Been commiserating, me and Sean
Think your face is getting long
Yeah who you running from?

(Sean)

You've been waiting in the waves
Waiting in the waves

I've been sipping poison just for fun
13 hours till I'm back home
Been obliterated, me and Sean
Getting good at getting gone
Yeah who you running from?

(Sean)
Stupid on the Steinway
So sick upon a Steinway
The sailors drown

See them talk and see them drown
And see them drink and fall around
Upon the floor
Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again
Lonely in a crowded room
The radio plays out of tune
So silently

The radio upon the floor
Is stupid it plays aznavour
So out of key

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again
Broken on a ship of fools
Even dreams must fall to rules
So stupidly
Words are all just useless sound
Just like cards they fall around
And we will be

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Buy a car and watch it rust
Sister see them fall to dust
They fall around

In another crowded room
Paint me like the shirt I'm in
Honestly
Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister.
Real life is so hard
We hide in the stars
That's where our heads are
My head and your heart

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate

When you are so far
I'm falling part
Lose all my sonar
You jam my radar

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck
Between the handshake and the fuck
You've got me on guard
I've got my head start
My head and your heart
The same in the stars

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck
Between the handshake and the fuck
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Okay
I got superstition
Ruling my decision
You are my religion
Haven't got a prayer

So just give me the sign and I'll follow you
When every angel's guarding you
You are my religion
Haven't got a prayer

I don't want to wait
To save your life
I think I know a way
To make things right

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me

Walking under ladders
Nothing really matters
There could be disaster
I don't really care

So just give me the sign and I'll follow you
When every angel's guarding you
There could be disaster
I don't really care

I don't want to wait
To save your life
I think I know a way
To make things right

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out

For me
For me

I don't want to wait
To save your life
I think I know a way
To make things right

Just give me the sign
Give me the sign
Give me the sign
Just give me the sign

Just give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me

Give me the sign and I'll come for you
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me
Give me the sign

Give me the sign
Give me the sign
Give me the sign
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight I throw myself in two
Out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
You're a real short ride, wow right
It'll beat you's up anyway, that's right
You're a teachers pet,  wow right
Sit and bleach one anyway, that's why

Color and the shape
Color and the shape

No sweat yeah, wow right
You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your ass away, wow right
Instead a river boy runs  away, that's right
Shape

You're a retard anyway, that's right
That is beat your hands away, wow right
Sell me river boy run away, that's why
Attention
Pay attention
No mention
A sickest array
A mission
An admission
Ignition
Detonate

Oh no don't talk about it
No please don't talk about it
Oh no don't talk about it
Not one more word about it
Oh no don't think about it

If you'd like to walk a while
We could waste the day
Follow me into the trees
I will lead the way

Bring some change up to the bridge
Bring some alcohol
There we'll make a final wish
Just before the fall

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Watch the sunrise all alone
Sitting on the tracks
Hear the train come roaring in
Never coming back

Laying quiet in the grass
Everything is still
River stones and broken bones
Scattered on the hill

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Here forever deep beneath the dirt
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one
I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine

She said how'd you like to waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Ahh!
Nikki!
Oh

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Ah!
Nikki!
Oh
Ah!
Come back Nikki! 
Come back!
Power is as sacred to  that they never even teach
Only if it's black or white see the challenges
Open eyes are broken if you'd just consider me
Cut you loose, I feel like I gotta gotta go!

Find an answer help yourself
Find an answer help yourself
Whatever kind of phony body chewed it through the night
Soda is left to block away the case of broken heart
Spit out fast for fun for it's the only way to win
Take my breathe come back inside, oh I gotta gotta go!

I got the answer help yourself
Find any answer help yourself
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution

'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life

Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly

I think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life

Run and tell the angels that everything is alright
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to

Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try and make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try and make this life my own

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life

Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly

Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to, learn to, learn to
They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done

Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Crazy TV dreams might be true
Not what it seems.
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should

Did you ever listen?
Get out
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free

Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I, I, I, I
You make me dizzy
Running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout

You can see this on my face
It's all for you
The more and more I take I break right through
Therapy still scares me
Putting me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out

Burn it in the blast off
Burn it in the blast off
Watch me crawl away
Try to get out
Try to get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

Breakout!
Go, go, go

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shining once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

Everytime I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun
I can be your trouble
Shiver into you
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black

When it comes closing in
Reject
Cause I gotta move
And the simple things get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove

The deeper the blues, the more I see black
The sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back 
All the deepest blues are black
Dearest constellation, heaven surroundin' you
Stay there, soft and blue.
Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two
Feelin' like I do, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight
Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
Hear me callin' you, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shapes become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight
Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shapes become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
The train that I got onto up and left that town
Threw it up as it went down
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around
Watched as they all took their vows

Fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway
Phase it out until the older ones return
Have a seat and watch it burn
Trace around the corner this is what I've learned
Always waited for my turn
Where you off to with that head of yours
Is there somewhere you should be
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me, baby

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
You'll see

What you up to now your mirror's gone
Is there someone you should be
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you
But honestly
But honestly
But honestly

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
No where to hide from me
You'll see

And tonight I thank the stars
As I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me
And all the words I gave to you
Something borrowed something blue
If you want them back
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you

I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
Something that I felt today, something that I had
Swingin' from the chandoleres, hanging on your word
I remember watchin' you once upon a time
Dancing from across the room in another life

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

Lookin' back to find my way, never sing so hard
Yesterday's belated rest, changing of the gods
I would never change a thing even if I could
All the songs we used to sing, everything was gone

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

One more Louvre that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you
One more tear that you won't hear
That's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

A little bit of resolve
One more Louvre that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)
A little bit of resolve
One more Louvre that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)
Hey you
Are you in there
I'm stuck outside you, ooh
We could use
One another
Another like you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you, ooh

Me and you
Going nowhere
I'm right beside you, ooh
Me and you
Going nowhere I'm right beside you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you

Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
Low as you go
Ooh, ooh

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
I am a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away
Then follows you back home
I am a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off alone

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

I am a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
This is the sound
The here and the now
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk
To get it all out

I listen
I listen
I listen

But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

Something I've found
Yea, That want to turn around
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk
To make any ground

You're pushing
You're pushing
You're pushing

But there ain't no room
No there ain't no room

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm trough
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never name again
I will never name again

We pretend it doesn't matter
We pretend it all away
We pretend it all away

We pretend
We pretend
We pretend

But it ain't no use
This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm through

This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you
To you
To you
To you
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper One last thing before I quit!  
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!
I still remember every single word you said,
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this

I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
When she goes storming out
I run for cover
Rolling like thunder clouds
Hanging above her

Ring in the witching hour
Spells that I'm singing
Rain come and drown me out
Sinking deep alone

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and

We could just lay around
Stare at the ceiling
Want to forget about
One for the feeling

Room full of photographs
Box full of letters
Come on make it last
Nothing else matters right now

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out

Lets go another round
I will bother you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out
Coming down I'm coming round
this time I think I'm waking up
Give me loud to drown it out
before the world starts breaking up
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Yours and mine and left and right
there's still two sides to everyone
You and I get on with life
and pray we'll find a better one
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers on the mend

Hurry now we're getting out
this time there's nothing stopping us
Leave behind this vacant town
tonight and let it turn to rust
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend

You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Coming down I'm coming round
this time I think I'm waking up
Give me loud to drown it out
before the world starts breaking up
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers on the mend

Overdrive we're going life or death (overdrive we're going life or death)
Overdrive we're going life or death (overdrive we're going life or death)
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers, no relation
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend
Seems like only yesterday
Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see
No looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Light began to fade
Into the black

Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly
Feel me anymore
Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything
Was said and done

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive
Still I tried to find my way
Spinning now was end of days
Burning like a flame
Behind my eyes

Drown it out
Drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, slave to the disguise
Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time
To say goodbye

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive
No reason left
Me to survive
You saved me
The day you came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Nothing wrong to give
I can finally live
Come alive
Your life into me
I can finally breathe
Come alive

Lay me down in the dark
Open my eyes
You saved me
The day you came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in, again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time our soul untold
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that will take you down
Bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
(Who dares)
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
(Who dares)
What if I say I will never surrender?

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him
In its just a quiet room
And he's there
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played
Hm mm mm

He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says never mind
And no one speaks

He thinks he drinks too much
Cause when he tells his two best friends
I think I drink too much

No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks
Hm hm mm mm mm hm hm mm

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar

That he played
When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
And he plays
No one speaks
Lately I've been measuring
Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin
Watch me spin

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones

All worn out and nothing fits
Brennivin and cigarettes
The more I give the less I get
But I'm all set
I'm all set

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones

Deep within this frame of mine
Heart of hearts a valentine
Tell my mom I'm doing fine
Doing fine
Doing fine

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just
Have you been headwired?
Were you satisfied?
Did it free the feelings in your spine?
Sleeping way inside all this time

Will your meet your mind
Where the night collides?
Will you greet yourself
When the sun arrives?

I'll just stay behind
I've met mine

Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now    

Help you feed the wires
When your head unwinds?
And if our headlines become entwined
You can have all mine
I'll be fine

There's a reason why
Keeping me alive
There's a cure in me
That I wish were mine
As long as I can fight, I'll survive
Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now
Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now

Stationed on the wire
One day I'll let go
Tell them all 'Hello'
Tell them all 'Hello'

The sun is on
Arlandria
Headwires
That night they were burning for truth
Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now what's a poor man left to do?

One heart now broken in two
You start untying the hands of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drumming
Mother Nature your Summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine
Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and in to the news
Come change, now shit getting heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screaming 'til I die
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself
Wreck your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Hey, where is the monument?
To the dreams we forget?
We need a monument
And change will come
Yeah change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
There?

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Amen
Where is the monument?
To the dreams we forget?
Amen
We need a monument
And change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
There?
Wake up it's time
Need to find a better place to hide
Make up, your mind
I need to know
I need to know tonight

[Chorus:]
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razor blade shine
Patience, my dear
We could spend a life time waiting here
Maybe this time
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye

[Chorus]

Day after day
Cuttin' away

Day after day
But anyway

Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up, your mind
I need to know
I need to know tonight
Sweet and devine
Razor blade shine
Call and I'll answer
At home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taken pleasure
In breaking down

Never mind the mannequins
Drunk in their hollow town
Drinking their spoils down
Cheap imitations
A revelation is now

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Counting every minute
Till the feeling comes crashing down
Run when it hits the ground
I'm good at escaping,
But better at flaking out

Calling unanswered
The center becomes blown out
Stuck in the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing
I never could face you down

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Red, red, laced around your head
Cold and rescued

Call and I'll answer
At home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taken pleasure
In breaking down

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
So you don't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Say goodbye to me
I'm going M.I.A.
I can find relief
I'm going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Better than playing dumb
There are days I might not make it
There are days I might start brakin
When the rain starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spear
Its in the square god damn I swear
There are times I feel like givin' in
There are times I begin to begin again
Look outside the world keeps spinning like a paddle wheel
Rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the heel

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

In the clear
There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember
How could I forget you painted stars into the sky
Coming like a reaper marching in the second life

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

In the clear

And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out!

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Dont you go count me out now dear

In the clear
Oh mirror mirror
You're coming in clear
I'm finally somewhere in between
I'm impressed
What a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene

Will you resign to the latest design
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire
Or wonderful liar?
I think its time we all should come clean
Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?

God bless, what a sensitive mess
Yeah but things aren't always what they seem
Your teary eyes
Your famous disguise
Never knowing who to believe

See through
Yeah, but what do you do?
When you're just another aging drag queen?

Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Every direction leads me away
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
All I want, is to be home

Stand in the mirror, you look the same
Just looking for shelter, from the cold and the pain
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
And all I want, is to be home

The echoes and silence, patience and grace
And all of these moments I'll never replace
Fear of my heart absence of faith
All I want, is to be home

All I want, is to be home

People I've loved, have no regrets
Some might remember, some might forget
Some of them livin', some of them dead
All I want, is to be home
I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I'll never be fraternity
I'll never need that brand of me
Fading the pace behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch you rise
Go on keep feeding
Swearing by the 
Swearing father
Swearing father

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I don't believe fraternities
See the disease fraternities
Wait of the hate behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch your rise
Go on keep feeding
Swearing by them 
Swearing father
Swearing father 

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Hand me down

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Bored in life
Bored in life
I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lily
The best I've ever seen

Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be
Enough space

Give me the flammable light
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go

Here lies a city on fire
Singing along
The arsonist choir
Now here I go

It's started with a spark
And burn into the dark
Now here I go

There is a river I've found
Into the wild
Under the ground
So here I go

A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
Took my word, I took your wine

And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

But you can't make me change my name
They'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now ain't that's something
Fuck it all I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse

It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh
All rise!

No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind no wait that's something
Fuck it all I came from nothing

I'm something
From nothing
I'm something
From nothing
It was meant to be
But all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by
Did you see me in your life
Flash before your eyes
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough
Hard enough for you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there
Elementary
I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when
Tear me up again
And I will let you know
When I've had enough
Had enough of you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there

I know you've got your reasons
Hey let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head

There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
Don't you deny me

There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there
The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true, the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
Together now, I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
When I talk about it
It carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons
All renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

When I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew

But it's you I fell into

When I talk about it
It carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons
All renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

I fell into
I fell into
Danny says we gotta go 
Gotta go to Idaho, 
But we can't go surfing 
'cause its 20 below
Sound checks at 5 o' 2 
Record stores and interviews 
Oh but I can wait to be with you 
Tomorrow

Baby oh oh oh 
We got nowhere to go 
And it may seem funny 
But it's true uhu uhuu

Hanging out in 100 feet 
Watchin' get smart on TV 
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me

Hangin' out in here 
Having nowhere to go o 
I ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow 
Listening to Sheena on the radio
Danny says we gotta go 
Gotta go to Idaho 
But we can't go surfing
Cause its 20 below

Baby oh oh oh 
We got nowhere to go 
And it may seem funny 
But it's true uhu uhuu

Hanging out in 100 feet 
Watchin' get smart on TV 
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me

Uh uh uh uh
Let's change the subject to someone else
You know lately I've been subject to change
Normally I reel in the strange
Hangover, I'm older

You're one to talk, the heart is a clock
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army to summon me

It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

My past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for taking things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over, and over

Doing my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I'm holding, still holding
Holding you in

It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh
Where the hell are you?

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time
Time
A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Getting good at starting over
Every time that I return
Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the days?
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growing stronger
Little conquerors
Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

Now,
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, again
To keep alive, a moment at a time
That's still inside, a whisper to a riot
The sacrifice, the knowing to survive
The first decline, another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die

I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die
I'm dancing on my grave
I'm running through the fire
Forever, whenever
I never wanna die
I never wanna leave
I'll never say goodbye
Forever, whenever
Forever, whenever
Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruises colors
Everything fades in time, it's true

Wish that I had another
Stab at the under cover
Was it a change in mind for you?

It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out?
Sit and watch
Your every mood

Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

Now that I've found my reward
Throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mine with you
Dear Haley
Can you save me from
The borrowed cloud I'm on
All you've gotta do is try
Pray you're just getting by

Hey wait I thought you made it
How'd your bottled crown fall off
Tell me how'd you get so tired
Fade it down to the wire

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time

So very ordinary
Wait until my bomb goes off
See the actors run and hide
Fake it all in stride

One day we all can say where we're gone
And haunt the ground we're from
Everything's so open wide
Hear within the divide

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time

Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time
Take a high dive in to your brain
Made your only cause
Just might wear your welcome out if you don't' let It go

There's nothing that you couldn't say Cauze you Said it all before
Think it's time you walked this lonely road all on Your own

So it's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

I could take it away
Save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else
Looking for someone to blame
Blame me all along
You take the heat but you would never take the Fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

You're so afraid that you are the only one
But you are the only one you know
Don't be afraid 'cause you're not the only one
You're not the only one I know

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper One last thing before I quit!  
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!
I still remember every single word you said,
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this

I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defence
Spinning infinity
Boy, the wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print, we are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face, mirrorin' your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees
So who are you? Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you? Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

What if I say you're not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

So who are you? Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
It was meant to be
But all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by

Did you see me in your life?
Flash before your eyes
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough
Hard enough for you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

There's a world out there
(There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me
(Don't you deny me)

Give me one last wish
(Give me one last wish)
There's a world out there
Elementary, I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine

Tell me lies or tell me when
Tear me up again
And I will let you know when I've had enough
Had enough of you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait

There's a world out there
(There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me
(Don't you deny me)

Give me one last wish
(There's a world out there)
There's a world out there
(Don't you deny me)

I know you've got your reasons
Hey, let's call it even
Turn out all the lights
And go to bed

Still I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts
Outside my head

There's a world out there
(There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me
(Don't you deny me)

Give me one last wish
(Give me one last wish)
Don't you deny me
(Don't you deny me)

There's a world out there
(There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me
(Don't you deny me)

Give me one last wish
(There's a world out there)
There's a world out there
(Don't you deny me)
I stick it to the mailman
I'm pinned against a pot plant
I'm sick of all the sun-tan
Oily with the ray-ban

Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon

I'm skinny as a spit pan
Dealing with the shit plan
Playing with my bad hand
Just another rock band

Take that to the man
and call it a check
Trapped within a contract

Hey there boy while you were catching the black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait

Hey man can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait
There ain't no secrets anymore
My name's been hanging on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

You're out of sight, I'm out of mind
Been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
Just a game of mine

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Days will come and go
No matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by
Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shinning once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

Every time I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black
Oh misery come marshal me in,
No better place for me to begin.
I'm coming in from out of this rain,
The time has come to wash you away.

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.

Oh bring to me your broken and blue,
No matter if it matters to you.
A longing like never before,
Ive had enough now i need more.

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come this means war.

Hey. Forgive me debility,
I'll sing you all my sins.

My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.

My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Well, I met the seventh son
He came for everyone
The day he heard the lighting in the field
I heard him clear his throat
A fork within the road
That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel

Ive been throwing knives
To see just where they land
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

The voice upon the stage
Is the heart inside a cage
And theyre singing like a bluebird in the round
Theres mystery in this wood
And ghosts within these roots
That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground

I've been going through life
Making foolish plans
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

And you need blind faith
No false hope
Do you have blind faith?
No false hope
Where is your blind faith?
No false hope
Open your eyes, open your eyes
Step into the light
Open your eyes, step into the light
The sound becomes
Congregation
A congregation
A congregation, yeah
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist, or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Or are you gone and onto someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose

My heart is under arrest again
But I'll break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You'd die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist, or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
One more day that I've survived
Another night alone
Pay no mind I'm doing fine
I'm breathing on my own

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Wake me when the hour arrives
Wake me with my name
See you somewhere down the line
We're tethered once again

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go

Close and stay a while
To take me where you go
Single file we walk the mile
Who's wandering back home

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true that you'll see

How could it be I'm the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity

I still refuse all the methods you've abused
It's all right if you're confused let me be

I've been around all the pawns
You've gagged and bound
They'll come back and knock you down and I'll be free

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan
It returns and when it lands words are due

I should've known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown
You were too

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I'll stick around and learn from all that came from it
Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know I need to know tonight
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razor blade shine
Patience my dear
We could spend a lifetime waiting here
Maybe this time
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine

Day after day
Cutting away
Day after day
But anyway

Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know I need to know tonight
Sweet and divine
Razor blade shine
Got my good side at the ready
If the other one is on the mend
Feel it in my bones when you break my back
Break it just to watch me bend
Anyway for once you admit it
No matter what your good book says
Never lookin' back 'cause I ain't no saint
Just another teenage head

You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white

Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Ain't no turning back cause I'm walkin' a line, 
Walkin' a line, walkin' a line
For you

Maybe if you swear you'll save me
Maybe save myself instead
Swear across my heart and I hope to die
Maybe we could just play dead
Runnin' out of time but I'm ready
Run out when I run this red
See you on the chase, I will track you down
Even though you're miles ahead

You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white

Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Ain't no turning back no there ain't no turning back,
No there ain't no turning back, no there ain't no turning back
Ain't no turning back 'cause I'm walkin' a line
Walkin' a line for you
Lately I've been measuring
Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin, watch me spin

Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?
I'm just skin and bones

All worn out and nothing fits
Brennivin and cigarettes
More I give the less I get
But I'm all set, I'm all set

Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones

Deep within this frame of mind
Heart of hearts, oh, Valentine
Tell my mom I'm doing fine
Doing fine, doing fine

Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?

Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just
You make me dizzy running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out

I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that
You know you make me break out
You can see this on my face
It's all for you
The more and more I take

I break right through
Therapy still scares me
Putting me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out
Burn it in the blast off

Burn it in the blast off
Watching me crawl away
Try to get out
Try to get out
You know you make me break out
Make me break out

I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that

Yeah
I don't want to look like that
Break out
Break out
Break out
Break out

Go, go, go
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that
You know you make me break out

Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that
Yeah
I don't want to look like that
I don't want to look like that

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
Make me break out
Yeah
Have you found your way around the down and out?
I know it must seem long, so long
I'm still trying' to keep this time from runnin' out
Head down, always movin' on and on and on
I never heard this warnin'

Another early mornin' takes me, wakes me into
If you could manage me, I'll try to manage you
But lately it's all I ever do
I felt like this on my way home

I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I know these things must bore you
I can't find another way
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I love this leash that holds me
When I try to run away

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
This indecision got me climbing up the wall
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all
Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,
I, go, noose
These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,
I, go, noose

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some hope I'm coming through, I'm coming out, yeah
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear when you go, 
I go, go
Tie up the transmission 
This one is not a test 
Silent all these years 
But now I'm getting you off my chest
Reeling in the moment, 
I know it will never last 
Tired of keepin' quiet, 
Riding with all the rest 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you 
For you

Hide behind obsessions, 
I'm trying to keep in check 
Ride you for the finish 
We're coming?? 
Reeling in the moment 
I know it will never last 
Rise up to the surface 
High but I'm sinking fast 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you
Here now, don't make a sound
Say, have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place

A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No harm, no life, no love
No stranger singin' in your name

But maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turnin' back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leavin' here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight
Sometimes I can't help the feeling that, 
I'm living a life of illusion
And oh, why can't we let it be
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion
I just can't help the feeling
I'm living a life of illusion

Pow! Right between the eyes
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises
Wow, it all seems so logical now
It's just one of her better disguises
And it comes with no warning
Nature loves her little surprises
Continual crisis

Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day
Caught up in endless solutions
That have no meaning, just another hunch
Based upon jumping conclusions
Endless solutions
Backed up against a wall of confusion

I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion
When I talk about it, it carries on 
For reasons only knew 
When I talk about it, the areas are 
For reasons only knew 

Big me to talk about it 
I stand the groove 
If we can get around it 
I'll know that its true 

When I talk about it, it carries on 
For reasons only knew 
But its you I fell in to 

Well I talked about it, carries on 
For reasons only knew 
When I talk about it, the areas are 
For reasons only knew 

Big me to talk about it 
I stand the groove 
If we can get around it 
I'll know that its true 

Well I talked about it, carries on 
Never was it true 
But its you I fell in to 

Well I talked about it, carries on 
Never was it true 
But its you I fell in to
Take your payroll
And your lottery
There's a place I know
There's a robbery

And I swear I'll never tell
If you swear you'll never tell
And we'll all make out so well
We will all make out so well

Head on with my hate
Into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted

Just the same old
Glitter story
From the sea floor
Metamorphosis
And I can't change back for you
I will not change back for you
I must live in skin that's new
I'm a livid skin that's new

Head on with my hate
Into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted

Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again
Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again

I'm amounted

And I can't change back for you
No I can't change back for you
One of these days, the ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days, your heart will stop and play it's final beat

One of these days, the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing
One of these days, their bombs will drop and silence everything

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart 'll be broken
I bet your pride 'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days, one of these days

One of these days, your eyes will close and pain will disappear
One of these days, you will forget to hope and learn to fear

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart 'll be broken
I bet your pride 'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days, one of these days

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Yeah it's alright
Don't say it's alright, don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
One of these days your heart will stop and play it's final beat

But it's alright, easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart will be broken
I bet your pride will be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away
Then follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off alone

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
Ooh look at me in a Cadillac
              You can play in a convertible child
              I've never been driven baby you're the first
              come on baby drive me wild,  ooh

              Ooh look at me on the telephone

              come on baby please it's so easy
              do it baby drive me wild

              come on baby do it drive me wild

              come on baby please it's so easy
              do it baby drive me wild
Can you hear me
Hear me screamin'
Breaking in the muted skies
This thunder heart
Like bombs beating
Echoing a thousand miles

Mine is yours and yours is mine
There is no divide
In your honor
I would die tonight

Mine is yours and yours is mine
I will sacrifice
In your honor
I would die tonight
For you to feel alive

Can you feel me
Feel me breathing
One last breathe before I close my eyes
This suffering
For receiving
Deliver me into the other side

For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
Ahh
Ain't that the way it always starts
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station

Hey, don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothing more to say
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down
Button up don't make a sound
Shame, shame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up

And when you said I couldn't give you enough,
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria,
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

Chase all of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you

Wait, I wanna see if you can change
I wanna keep all I can take
I feel much better now
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms

Shame, shame go away, come again some other day
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away
Hush, now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground
Come now, take the blame, that's OK I'll play the game
I don't care it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh
Early morning without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the sun was dead
Make me warm or take me home
It's so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Come on over brave my storm
Ocean's overhead
Come inside my friend
Getting bad out there
Every moment we have stolen
All we had to share
No one wanted this
But you know I did
You know I did
This moment

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end
Have you ever been dumb enough to do what you wanted to do
Without good reason coming over you?
Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel?
Take back those years for something real

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Have you ever been drunk enough to say what you wanted to say
Without no words getting in the way?
Have you ever been in love enough to be who you wanted to be?
I won't mind you if you won't mind me

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Can you believe we're older?
I won't believe it's over now
Do you remember being children?
Do you remember when? Now

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Held against my will
There is a secret
I found a secret
Behind a Soho door

There is a reason
I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor

I found the water
The devils water
And walked along its shore

Is that what you want?

The channels changing
The heart is racing
From voices on a wire

The soul is yearning
The cold is burning
The ember starts a fire

Can we recover
Love for each other
The measure of your life

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want

A river
A river
A river running under ground

A river
A river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I! I! I am a river

Is that what you want
Is that what you really want

I! I! I am a river

I am a river!

I! I! I am a river
Back and forth that voice of yours keeps me up at night
Help me search to find the words that eat you up inside
I go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane
And I only hide what is on my mind because I can't explain

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

It's my turn this solo burn so throw me in the fire
Trophies earned and lessons learned, my wicked little lies
We can pave new roads with the cold creed stones, wind them through the pines
Should I stay or should I go alone? I cannot decide

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
I can be your right of way
So we can get out of here
I've always been the one
Who runs from everyone
Cos everyone's just too weird

Sink with someone tied to me
I'm making you volunteer
Another one has come and gone
They crawl along
Make them disappear
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you

Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long
I waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone
They crawl along
Wasting all these years
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you

How can you go on
When you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do

Gimme stitches
Now or never
Before I get my blood on you
Crazy but I believe this time
Begging for sweet relief
A blessing in disguise
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep
Please come to me tonight
Hands on a miracle
I've got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
That you'd it away

Everything that we survived
It's gonna be alright
Just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searching every where
You're right here in my sight
Good and bad 
I swear I've had them both, they're overrated 
But is it fun 
When you get hold of one 
Some gone bad 
And some gone back 
Good ones all get taken I'm callin' bluff 
You ain't strong enough
 
Wait and pray you'll pick on me 
the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned 

Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Say your prayers when you get scared 
Pray you're gonna make it 
And then when you're done 
You keep fucking up 
One day soon I'll disappear 
And if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go 
To keep from growing old 

Wait and pray you'll pick on me 
the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned 

Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Oh, oh, oh
 
Disappear, the light is fading
Disappear, outside their rage 
Disappear, I'm tired of waiting
Disappear before we get away

Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows
Right behind me everywhere I go 
oh, oh oh
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one die

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)

Think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away
If you give me one last try

We live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything is all right

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly

Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to

Looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly
Make my way back home
When I learn to
This is the sound
The here and the now
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk
To get it all out

I listen
I listen
I listen

But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

Something I've found
Yea, That want to turn around
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk
To make any ground

You're pushing
You're pushing
You're pushing

But there ain't no room
No there ain't no room

This is The last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm trough
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never name again
I will never name again

We pretend it doesn't matter
We pretend it all away
We pretend it all away

We pretend
We pretend
We pretend

But it ain't no use
This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm through

This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you
To you
To you
To you
Lyrics
If ever you think you're not the one
I'll remind you
If ever you think you're 'bout to run
I will follow you

Come on to me
Just let it go
If ever you think you're not the one
I'll remind you

Come on my love
Come on my love

If ever you think I'm not the one
I'll remind you
With everything under the sun
Stars above you

Come on to me
Just let it go
If ever you think I'm not the one
I'll remind you

Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love

Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love
Come on my love

If ever you think you're not the one
I'll remind you
If ever you think you're not the one


Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one die

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)

Think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away
If you give me one last try

We live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything is all right

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying  
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)

Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
You're my size I need to try you on 
Someone in between the right and wrong
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Through everything you stayed that same old heart 
And when I've had enough 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
Go on and have it all. 

Running through this maze you hold me in
Searching all these days to find the end 
Your everything, your everything I'm not
But I'm anything, I'm anyone you want 
And when I've had enough 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me
Go on and have it all
Have it all
Have it all

Your everything you're everything I'm not 
I'm anything I'm anyone you want 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep  
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 

Have it all
Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Kudos, my hero, leavin' all the best
You know my hero, the one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
I have a choice between the bat or the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confessions, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind, I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up

Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell?
Spare me the questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize I get shy and I choke up!
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal?
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

Farewell, my sweet paramania
Farewell, my sweet paramania
My only promise is that I'll never tell
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
I take it all back anyway.

What was I supposed to say?
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal?
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up
What would I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can choose
What would I do?
Lonely as you

Pleasure or pain I can choose

Wake up your dream and I can't stand your screamin'
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meanin'
Spare all the preachin' my secret's worth keepin'
No one understands like I do

Keep out of reach I'm your leadin' deletion
Hide behind these masks
Though they still see right through them
Every now and then
You're down and out my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe
Blame it on you thought these years I've been losin'
Blame it on the past it's the last place I knew you
Blame all the children their rage and their ruin
Blame it on the black and the blue
Every now and then
You're down and out my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again
I'm down with you

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe
Every now and then
You're down and out my friend
Down and out again
Down and out again
Down and out again
But I'm done with you

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the last time
Everyone wants to believe

One more time for the last time
One more time for release
One more time for the very last time
Everyone wants to believe
All Right!
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper One last thing before I quit!
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!
I still remember every single word you said,
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this

I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me

Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again

The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Breathe out
So I could breathe you in
Hold you in

And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again

The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again

The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Once upon a time I was somebody else
In another life I saw myself
Way back then, back when I was new

Somewhere down the line I started to slip
Years gone by, biting my lip
All the while, all this time I knew

Now you're on your own, one for the pages
Over the hill and through the ages
Does my heaven burn like hell on you?

Out beneath the cracks they're coming in waves
Rolling like an earthquake under the pavement
Tell me now, tell me Mr. True
You got a lot of nerve

Now show a little backbone why don't you?
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out

Holding my breath, I waited and waited
How'd this simple life get so complicated?
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you
Deer in the headlight, spoke in the wheel
You all pretend, I need for real
Taking it back, all my IOUs
You got a lot of nerve

Now show a little backbone why don't you?
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out

You got a lot of nerve, nerve, nerve, nerve

Now show a little backbone why don't you?
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I'm looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me

I couldn't grow just living in the shadow
Where do you go when no one's following you?
You ran away, ran away it was right on cue

Shall I go on, and on, and on,
And on, and on, and on again?

Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary

You've got a way, got a way, got a way with things
You got away, got away, got away with things
False starts, young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces coming down around you
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

Can I go on, and on, and on,
And on, and on, and on again?

Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

This was no ordinary life
(This was no ordinary life)
This was no ordinary life
(This was no ordinary life)

I'm here from now on
But once I'm gone
I'm gone

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)
You're a part of me (you're part of me)
Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)
Please pardon me (please pardon me)
Dear Rosemary

You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
When all is said and done
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these broken wings floating
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

On into the sun
On into the sun

Looking down at you, sleeping
From above, I love
Looking down at you, weeping
From above, I love

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

When all is dead and gone
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these dying arms, see them
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

Heaven skies are reeling
And my hand that holds the world
Deep inside I'm reaching
Into the universe

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
