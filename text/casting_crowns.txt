Lyrics
You were broken, abandoned
And crying all alone
We were waiting and praying
And longing to bring you home
And then we saw your face
In a moment you were wrapped up in our hearts
We took a step of faith
And now here we are

Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you
Will you take my love and give up the fight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you

From a world away, I journeyed
Just to hold your hand
You will never be alone again
I've come so far to find you
So far to find you

You were fighting and fearful
You were hiding your heart away
But I was trying so hard to show you
'Cause there were no words that I could say
If you could see my heart
You would know that all I want to do
Is care for you

Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you
Will you take my love and give up the fight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you

Here in your eyes I see
Reflections of myself
How I'm the child that's really running
But I can hear a voice that's whispering my name
Saying come to me, don't run from me
I'm all you need and I am calling

Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight
(I have come so far)
Will you take my love and give up the fight
(I have come so far)

Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you
Will you take my love and give up the fight
I have come so far to find you
So far to find you

From Heaven's throne
Down to a rugged cross I came
It was My love for you that brought Me all the way
So far to find you
So far to find you

You were broken, abandoned
And crying all alone
What do you think about when you look at me
I know we're not the fairy tale you dreamed we'd be
You wore the veil, you walked the aisle, you took my hand
And we dove into a mystery

How I wish we could go back to simpler times
Before all our scars and all our secrets were in the light
Now on this hallowed ground, we've drawn the battle lines
Will we make it through the night?

It's going to take much more than promises this time
Only God can change our minds
Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever is broken together

How it must have been so lonely by my side
We were building kingdoms and chasing dreams and left love behind
I'm praying God will help our broken hearts align
And we won't give up the fight

It's going to take much more than promises this time
Only God can change our minds
Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever is broken together
Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever is broken together
What if the armies of the Lord
Picked up and dusted off their swords
Vowed to set the captives free
And not let Satan have one more

What if the church, for heaven's sake
Finally stepped up to the plate
Took a stand upon God's promise
And stormed hell's rusty gates

What if His people prayed
And those who bear His name
Would humbly seek His face
And turn from their own way

And what would happen if we prayed
For those raised up to lead the way
Then maybe kids in school could pray
And unborn children see light of day

What if the life that we pursue
Came from a hunger for the truth
What if the family turned to Jesus
Stopped asking Oprah what to do

He said that they would hear
His promise has been made
He'll answer loud and clear
If only we would pray

If My people called by My name
If they'll humble themselves and pray
If My people called by My name
If they'll humble themselves and pray
Sweet little Jesus boy, born in a manger
Sweet little Holy child, we didn't know who You were
Long time ago it seems, You were born
Born in a manager Lord, sweet little Jesus boy

Didn't know you'd come to save us all
To take our sins away
Our eyes were blind we did not see
We didn't know who You were

You have shown us how 
And we are trying
Master, You have shown us how
Even as You were dying
This world treats You mean, Lord
Treats me mean too
But that's how things are done down here
We didn't know it was You

Didn't know You'd come to save us all, to take our sins away
Our eyes were blind, we did not see
We didn't know who You were
I spend all my time
Dreaming what the future's gonna bring
When all of this time
There's a world passing by right in front of me
Set my sights on tomorrow
While I'm tripping over today

Who says big things
Are somewhere off in the distance
I don't want to look back
Just to see all the times that I missed it
I want to be here and now
Starting right here, right now

With the very next words of love to be spoken
To the very next heart that's shattered and broken
To the very next way you're gonna use me
Show me the next thing
I'll do the next thing

Let my very next breath
Breathe out a song of praise to you
With my very next step
Be on a road that was planned by you
Lord, wherever you're leading me
That's where I want to be

With the very next words of love to be spoken
To the very next heart that's shattered and broken
To the very next way you're gonna use me
Show me the next thing
I'll do the next thing

Eyes wide open I see you working
All around me you're on the move
Step by step I'm running to meet you
In the next thing, in the next thing

Eyes wide open I see you working
All around me you're on the move
Step by step I'm running to meet you
In the next thing

With the very next words of love to be spoken
To the very next heart that's shattered and broken
To the very next way you're gonna use me
Show me the next thing

Eyes wide open I see you working
All around me you're on the move (I'll do the next thing)
Step by step I'm running to meet you
In the next thing, in the next thing

Eyes wide open I see you working
All around me you're on the move (I'll do the next thing)
Step by step I'm running to meet you
In the next thing, in the next thing

Eyes wide open I see you working
All around me you're on the move
Step by step I'm running to meet you
In the next thing, in the next thing
Looking out from his throne
The father of light and of men
Chose to make himself known
And show us the way back to him

Speaking wisdom and truth
Into the hearts of peasants and kings
He began to unveil
The word that would change the course of all things

With eyes wide open all would see

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive
Simple strokes on a page
Eternity's secrets revealed
Carried on from age to age
It speaks truth to us even still

As the rain falls from heaven
Feeds the earth before it returns
Lord, let your word fall on us
And bring forth the fruit you deserve

With eyes wide open let us see

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive

The bible was inscribed over a period of 2000 years
In times of war and in days of peace
By kings, physicians, tax collectors, farmers, fishermen, singers and shepherds
The marvel is that a library so perfectly cohesive
Could have been produced by such a diverse crowd
Over a period of time which stagers the imagination
Jesus is it's grand subject our good is designed and the glory of God is its end

The word is alive
And it cuts like a sword through darkness
With a message of life to the hopeless and the frail
Breathing life into all who believe
The word is alive
And the world and its glories will fade
But his truth it will not pass away
It remains yesterday and forever the same
The word is alive

The word is alive (the world and its glories will fade)
The word is alive (his truth it will not pass away)
His word is alive (his word is alive, his word is alive)
Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate
I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace 
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
Your love is extravagant

[Chorus]
Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known You considered me a friend
Capture my heart again
Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend
Capture my heart again
Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate
I have a song that the angels can't sing
You saved my weary soul from all my sin and pain and suffering
A song of the redeemed, I once was lost but You found me
Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing

I have a song that the angels can't sing
You stepped out of Your throne all wrapped in flesh
You made Yourself like me
A song of righteousness I couldn't reach till You reached me
Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing

Oh, glory hallelujah to the Lamb that was slain
I cannot hold it in, You've given me a brand-new name
A song of my deliverance
You've broken all my chains and I am free
Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I have a song that the angels can't sing
I was sentenced to a life in chains, no hope for being free
You opened up the door and said, “come on and follow Me”
Now I have a song that the angels can't sing

Oh, glory hallelujah to the Lamb that was slain
I cannot hold it in, You've given me a brand-new name
A song of my deliverance
You've broken all my chains and I am free
Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I have a song that the angels can't sing
It goes, “Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see”
Now I have a song that the angels can't sing
Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing
Now I have a song that the angels can't sing

Oh, glory hallelujah to the Lamb that was slain
I cannot hold it in, You've given me a brand-new name
A song of my deliverance
You've broken all my chains and I am free
Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing

Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing
Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing
Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn
Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn
Facing for sinners death on the cross
That He might save them from endless loss

Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
Blind and unheeding, dying for me

'Father, forgive them,' my Savior prayed
Even while His lifeblood flowed fast away
Praying for sinners while in such woe
No one but Jesus ever loved so

Dying for me

Oh how I love Him, Savior and friend
How can my praises ever find end
Through years unnumbered on Heaven's shore
My songs shall praise Him forevermore
It hasn't always been this way
I remember brighter days
Before the dark ones came
Stole my mind
Wrapped my soul in chains

Now I live among the dead
Fighting voices in my head
Hoping someone hears me crying in the night
And carries me away

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

Morning breaks another day
Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?
The dark ones shriek
They scream his name
Is this the one they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free 

And as the god man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
And darkness cannot hide

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

You are free
You are free
You are free
We are free
We are free
Jesus set us free
There's a stirring in the throne room
And all creation holds it's breath
Waiting now to see the bride groom
Wondering how the bride will dress
And she wears white
And she knows that she's undeserving
She bears the shame of history
With this worn and weary maiden
Is not the bride that he sees
And she wears white, head to toe
But only he could make it so

When someone dries your tears
When someone wins your heart
And says your beautiful
When you don't know you are
And all you've longed to see
Is written on his face
When love has come and finally set you free
On that wedding day
On that wedding day

She has danced in golden castles
And she has crawled through beggar's dust
But today she stands before him
And she wears his righteousness
And she will be who he adores
And this is what he made her for

When someone dries your tears
When someone wins your heart
And says your beautiful
When you don't know you are
And all you've longed to see
Is written on his face
When love has come and finally set you free
On that wedding day
On that wedding day

When the hand that bears the only scars
And heaven touch her face
And the last tears she'll ever cry
Are finally wiped away
And the clouds roll back as he takes her hand
And walks her through the gates
Forever we will reign

When someone dries your tears
When someone wins your heart
And says your beautiful
When you don't know you are
And all you've longed to see
Is written on his face
When love has come and finally set you free
On that wedding day
On that wedding day
What this world needs
Is not another one-hit wonder with an axe to grind
Another two-bit politician peddling lies
Another three-ring circus society

What this world needs
Is not another sign-waving super- that thinks he's better than you
Another ear-pleasing candy man afraid of the truth
Another prophet in an Armani suite

[Chorus:]
What this world needs is a savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love them
In their time of need
A savior who will rescue
A spirit who will lead
A father who will love
That's what this world needs

What this world needs
Is for us to care more about the inside than the outside
Have we become so blind that we can't see
God's gotta change your heart before he changes a shirt
What this world needs
Is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance
Blending in so well that people can't see the difference
And it's the difference that sets the world free

[Chorus]

People aren't confused by the gospel
They're confused by us
Jesus is the only way to god
But we are not the only way to Jesus

This world doesn't need my tie, my hoodie
My denomination or my translation of the bible
They just need Jesus
We can be passionate about what we believe
But we can't strap ourselves to the gospel

'Cause we're slowing it down
Jesus is going to save the world
But maybe the best thing we can do
Is just get out of the way

[Chorus]

Jesus is our savior
That's what this world needs
The father's arms around you
That's what this world needs
That's what this world needs
From where I'm standing
Lord it's so hard for me to see
Where this is going
And where You're leading me
I wish I knew how
All my fears and all my questions
Are gonna play out
In a world I can't control

Oh, oh

When I'm lost in the mystery
To You my future is a memory
Cause You're already there
You're already there
Standing at the end of my life
Waiting on the other side
And You're already there
You're already there

Oh, oh, oh, oh

From where You're standing
Lord, You see a grand design
That You imagined
When You breathed me into life
And all the chaos
Comes together in Your hands
Like a masterpiece
Of Your picture perfect plan
When I'm lost in the mystery
To You my future is a memory
Cause You're already there
You're already there
Standing at the end of my life
Waiting on the other side
And You're already there
You're already there

One day I'll stand before You
And look back on the life I've lived
I can't wait to enjoy the view
And see how all the pieces fit
And see how all the pieces fit

One day I'll stand before You
And look back on the life I've lived
Cause You're already there
You're already there
When I'm lost in the mystery
To You my future is a memory
Cause You're already there
You're already there
Standing at the end of my life
Waiting on the other side
And You're already there
You're already there

You are already there
Who am I, that the lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt?
Who am I, that the bright and morning star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wandering heart?

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love
And watch me rise again?
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain
And calm the storm in me?

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

I am yours
I am yours
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear?
'Cause I am yours
I am yours
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And mild and sweet their songs repeat
Of peace on earth good will to men

And the bells are ringing (peace on earth)
Like a choir they're singing (peace on earth)
In my heart I hear them (peace on earth)
Peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

But the bells are ringing (peace on earth)
Like a choir singing (peace on earth)
Does anybody hear them? (peace on earth)
Peace on earth, good will to men

Then rang the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor does he sleep (peace on earth, peace on earth)
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail 
With peace on earth, good will to men

Then ringing singing on its way

The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men

And the bells they're ringing (peace on earth)
Like a choir they're singing (peace on earth)
And with our hearts we'll hear them (peace on earth)
Peace on earth, good will to men

Do you hear the bells they're ringing? (peace on earth)
The life the angels singing (peace on earth)
Open up your heart and hear them (peace on earth)
Peace on earth, good will to men

Peace on earth, peace on earth
Peace on earth, Good will to men
All work no play may have made Jack a dull boy
But all work no God has left Jack with a lost soul
But he's moving on full steam
He's chasing the American dream
He's gonna give his family the finer things

Not this time son I've no time to waste
But maybe tomorrow we'll have time to play
And then he slips into his new little BMW
And drives farther and farther, farther away

'Cause he works all day and tries to sleep at night
He tells him thing will get better
Oh better in time

So he works and he builds with his own two hands
And he pours all he has in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are comin' crashing in
Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
But will his kingdom stand?

His American Dream is beginning to seem
More and more like a nightmare
With every passing day
Daddy, can you come to my game?
Oh Baby, please don't work late
Another wasted weekend
And they are slipping away

'Cause he works all day and lies awake at night
He tells them things will get better
Just take a little more time

So he works and he builds with his own two hands
And he pours all he had in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
But will his kingdom stand?

He used to say, whoever dies with the most toys wins
But if he loses his soul, what has he gained in the end
I'll take a shack on the rock
Over a castle in the sand
Now he works all day and cries alone at night
It's not getting any better
Looks like he's running out of time

'Cause he worked and he built with his own two hands
And he poured all he had in a castle made with sand
But the wind and the rain are coming crashing in
Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands
His kingdom stands

All they really wanted was You
All they really wanted was You
All they really wanted was You
Father, hear my prayer
I need the perfect words
Words that he will hear
And know they're straight from you
I don't know what to say
I only know it hurts
To see my only friend slowly fade away

So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life
With your fire in my eyes
But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words
What am I so afraid of?

'cause here I go again
Talking 'bout the rain
And mulling over things that won't live past today
And as I dance around the truth
Time is not his friend
This might be my last chance to tell him
That you love him
But here I go again, here I go again
Here I go again

Lord, you love him so, you gave your only son
If he will just believe, he will never die
But how then will he know what he has never heard
Lord he has never seen mirrored in my life

So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life
With your fire in my eyes
But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words
What am I so afraid of?

'cause here I go again
Talking 'bout the rain
And mulling over things that won't live past today
And as I dance around the truth
Time is not his friend
This might be my last chance to tell him
That you love him
But here I go again, here I go again
Here I go, here I go again

So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life
With your fire in my eyes
But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words
What am I so afraid of?

'cause here I go again
Talking 'bout the rain
And mulling over things that won't live past today
And as I dance around the truth
Time is not his friend
This might be my last chance to tell him
That you love him
This might be my last chance to tell him
That you love him
You love him, you love him

What am I so afraid
What am I so afraid
What am I so afraid of?
How then will he know
What he has never heard
It's crowded in worship today
As she slips in trying to fade into the faces
The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than they know
Farther than they know

But if we are the body
Why aren't His arms reaching?
Why aren't His hands healing?
Why aren't His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren't His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
There is a way, there is a way

A traveler is far away from home
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
The weight of their judgmental glances
Tells him that his chances are better out on the road

But if we are the body
Why aren't His arms reaching?
Why aren't His hands healing?
Why aren't His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren't His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?

Jesus paid much too high a price
For us to pick and choose who should come

And we are the body of Christ
But if we are the body
Why aren't His arms reaching?
Why aren't His hands healing?
Why aren't His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren't His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
Jesus is the way
Jesus is the way
we are His hands
We are His feet
We are His body
Jesus is the way
Be careful little eyes what you see
It's the second glance that ties your hands
As darkness pulls the strings
Be careful little feet where you go
For it's the little feet behind you that are sure to follow

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade

Be careful little ears what you hear
When flattering leads to compromises, the end is always near
Be careful little lips what you say
For empty words and promises leave broken hearts astray

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade

The journey from your mind to your hands
Is shorter than you're thinking
Be careful if you think you stand
You just might be sinking

It's a slow fade when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
When you give yourself away

People never crumble in a day
Daddies never crumble in a day
Families never crumble in a day

Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
For the Father up above is looking down in love
Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
O God, You are my God
And earnestly I seek You
O how I long for You
In this dry and weary land
IÃ¢??ve seen You in the sanctuary
And I beheld Your glory
So I can think of only one thing I can do

I lift my hands
I lift my hands and I will praise You all my days
I lift my voice
I lift my voice to You in this simple song of praise
I lift my eyes
So I will think of You through the watches of the night
Hear the voices ring as Your children sing
In the shadow of Your wings

Hear the voices ring as the children sing
Hear the voices ring as the children sing
Hear the voices ring as the children sing

In the shadow of Your wings
In the shadow of Your wings
Jesus, friend of sinners, we have strayed so far away
We cut down people in your name but the sword was never ours to swing
Jesus, friend of sinners, the truth's become so hard to see
The world is on their way to You but they're tripping over me
Always looking around but never looking up I'm so double minded
A plank eyed saint with dirty hands and a heart divided

Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
Open our eyes to the world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh Jesus, friend of sinners, break our hearts for what breaks yours

Yeah

Jesus, friend of sinners, the one who's writing in the sand
Make the righteous turn away and the stones fall from their hands
Help us to remember we are all the least of thieves
Let the memory of Your mercy bring Your people to their knees
No one knows what we're for only against when we judge the wounded
What if we put down our signs crossed over the lines and loved like You did

Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
Open our eyes to world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh Jesus, friend of sinners, break our hearts for what breaks yours

You love every lost cause; you reach for the outcast
For the leper and the lame; they're the reason that You came
Lord I was that lost cause and I was the outcast
But you died for sinners just like me, a grateful leper at Your feet

'Cause You are good, You are good and Your love endures forever
You are good, You are good and Your love endures forever
You are good, You are good and Your love endures forever
You are good, You are good and Your love endures forever

Oh Jesus, friend of sinners
Open our eyes to world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh Jesus, friend of sinners, break our hearts for what breaks Yours

And I was the lost 'cause and I was the outcast
Yeah
You died for sinners just like me, a grateful leper at Your feet
Here in this worn and weary land
Where many a dream has died

Like a tree planted by the water
We never will run dry

So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of You
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
With one desire

Just to know You and yo make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun made darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

Woah
Woah

Into Your word we're digging deep
To know our Father's heart

Into the world we're reaching out
To show them who You are

So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of You
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
With one desire

Just to know You and to make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun made darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

Joy unspeakable, faith unsinkable,
Love unstoppable, anything is possible
Joy unspeakable, faith unsinkable,
Love unstoppable, anything is possible
Joy unspeakable, faith unsinkable,
Love unstoppable, anything is possible
Joy unspeakable, faith unsinkable,
Love unstoppable, anything is possible

Just to know You and to make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun made darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive
Hey!

Woah
Woah

Woah
Woah

We were made to thrive
There's an old man living in the back of your woods tonight
You forgot he was even there, but you've never slipped his mind
He's living off of scraps of you you never knew you left behind
And as the sun goes down, he rises with a smile

He's waiting on the night to fall
The old man's coming to call
But you don't see the writing on the wall
He'll never step out in the light
No, he's just biding time
And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all
He's waiting on the night to fall
He's waiting on the night to fall

He knows you have the answers, but truth lies dusty on your shelf
And the sword that you could slay him with has become an ornament and nothing else
You could put him back down in his hole in the ground, but he knows you never will
He's been around so long you got used to the smell

He's waiting on the night to fall
The old man's coming to call
But you don't see the writing on the wall
He'll never step out in the light
No, he's just biding his time
And as you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all
He's waiting on the night to fall
He's waiting on the night to fall

He knows he'll never have your soul
But he will gladly rob you blind
While you're feasting at his table, he'll tie your hands and numb your mind
He'll take you farther than you wanna go
He'll keep you longer than you wanna stay
And it will cost you more than you ever thought you'd pay

He's waiting on the night to fall
The old man's coming to call
But you don't see the writing on the wall
He'll never step out in the light
No, he's just biding his time
And as you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all
He's waiting on the night to fall
He's waiting on the night to fall

He's waiting on the night
He's waiting on the night to fall
The old man's coming to call
But you don't see, you don't see the writing on the wall
He's waiting on the night
He's waiting on the night to fall
He's waiting on the night to fall
Here I am lord and I'm drowning
In your sea of forgetfulness
The chains of yesterday surround me
I yearn for peace and rest
I don't want to end up where you found me
And it echoes in my mind
Keeps me awake tonight

I know you've cast my sin as far
As the east is from the west
And I stand before you now
As though I've never sinned
But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I start the day, the war begins
Endless reminding of my sin
And time and time again
Your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in
Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
From you leaving me this way

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

I know you've washed me white
Turned my darkness into light
I need your peace to get me through
To get me through this night

I can't live by what I feel
About the truth your word reveals
And I'm not holding onto you
But you're holding onto me
You're holding onto me

Jesus, can you show me just how far the east is from the west?
Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
Rising up in me again
In the arms of your mercy I find rest
You know just how far the east is from the west
From one scarred hand to the other

Just how far, the east is from the west, just how far
From one scarred hand to the other
You know just how far, the east is from the west, just how far
From one scarred hand to the other
Hey, David, I hear you've been dreaming
About being a big time shepherd some day
You're gonna prove your brothers wrong
You're gonna sing your shepherd song
To the cattle on a thousand hills
But I've been thinking

I'm having trouble with a giant down the road
You're the one who's going to face him toe to toe
Wipe that grin right off his face
And whip this army into shape
I'm going to turn the nation back to Me
And David, you're right about one thing
Your little shepherd songs are going to make the whole world sing
And I'm gonna make you king

So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you
I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you
So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand
I'll show you what I can do
When I dream for you
I have a dream for you

Hey Mary, I've heard you've been dreaming
Making plans for your big wedding day
You and Joseph are gonna be
The picture perfect family
Maybe a couple of kids down the road
But I've been thinking

Even before time began
I had a picture perfect plan
Of how to save this broken world
Through the life of just one man
I'm gonna send my only Son
And Mary, you're the one
You were right about one thing
You're gonna have that family
And you're gonna raise a King

So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you
I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you
So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand
I'll show you what I can do
When I dream for you
When I dream for you

I'm stronger than you think, I am
I'll take you farther than you think you can
You sing and call me Great I Am
So take your stand
My child, if you only knew
All the plans that I have for you
Just trust me, I will follow through
You can follow Me

So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you
I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you
So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand
I'll show you what I can do

So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you
I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you
So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand
I'll show you what I can do
When I dream for you
When I dream for you
When I dream for you
I have a dream for you
Joyful, joyful, we adore You
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before You

Opening to the sun above
Joyful, joyful, we adore You
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before You

Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away

Joyful, joyful, we adore You
Hearts unfold like flowers before You
Joyful, joyful, we adore You
Joyful, we adore You

All Your works with joy surround You
Earth and Heaven reflect Your ways
Stars and angels sing around You
Center of unbroken praise
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away

God, our Father
Christ, our Brother
All who live in love are thine
Teach us how to love each other
Lift us to the joy divine

Oh, God, our Father
Christ, our Brother
All who live in love are thine
Teach us how to love each other
If you ask me to leap
Out of my boat on the crashing waves
If You ask me to go
Preach to the lost world that Jesus saves

I'll go, but I cannot go alone
Cause I know I'm nothing on my own
But the power of Christ in me makes me strong
Makes me strong
Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me
Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability
How refreshing to know You don't need me
How amazing to find that You want me
So I'll stand on Your truth, 
And I'll fight with Your strength
Until You bring the victory, 
By the power of Christ in me

If You ask me to run
And carry Your light into foreign land
If You ask me to fight
Deliver Your people from Satan's hand

I'll go, but I cannot go alone
Cause I know I'm nothing on my own
But the power of Christ in me makes me strong
Makes me strong
Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me
Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability
How refreshing to know You don't need me
How amazing to find that You want me
So I'll stand on Your truth, 
And I'll fight with Your strength
Until You bring the victory, 
By the power of Christ in me

To reach out with Your hands
To learn through Your eyes
To love with the love of a Savior
To feel with Your heart
And to think with Your mind
I'd give my last breath for Your glory
Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me
Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability

When I'm weak, You make me strong
When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me
Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability
How refreshing to know You don't need me
How amazing to find that You want me
So I'll stand on Your truth, 
And I'll fight with Your strength
Until You bring the victory, 
By the power of Christ in me

The power of Christ in me
The power of Christ in me
What if you could go back and relive one day of your life all over again
And unmake the mistake that left you a million miles away
From the you, you once knew
Now yesterday's shame keeps saying that you'll never get back on track
But what if I told you

You're one step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone
You're one step away

It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Mercy says you don't have to keep running down the road you're on
Love's never met a lost cause
Your shame, lay it down
Leave your ghosts in the past ‘cause you know that you can't go back
But you can turn around
You've never been more than

One step away from surrender
One step away from coming home, coming home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (not alone)
You're one step away
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're one step away

So come on home, come on home
One step from arms wide open
His love has never let you go
You're not alone (you're not alone)
You're one step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Take up, take up your new name

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
One step away

Lay down, lay down your old chains
Come now, and take up your new name
Your best life up ahead now
You're just one step away
Is there anyone that fails?
Is there anyone that falls?
Am I the only one in church today, feeling so small?
Cause when I take a look around
Everybody seems so strong
I know they'll soon discover
That I don't belong
So I tuck it all away
Like everything's OK
If I make em all believe it
Maybe I'll believe it too
So with a painted grin
I'll play the part again
So everyone will see me
The way that I see them

Are we happy plastic people
Under shiny plastic steeples
With walls around our weakness
And smiles that hide our pain
But the invitations open
To every heart that's been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

Is there anyone who's been there?
Are there any hands raised?
Am I the only one who's traded
In the altar for a stage?
The performance is convincing
And we know every line in my heart
Only when no one is watching can we really fall apart
But would it set me free
If I dared to let you see
The truth behind the person
You imagine me to be
Or would your eyes be opened
Or would you walk away
Would the love of Jesus
Be enough to make you stay?

Are we happy plastic people
Under shiny plastic steeples
With walls around our weakness
And smiles that hide our pain
But the invitations open
To every heart that's been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

Are we happy plastic people
Under shiny plastic steeples
With walls around our weakness
And smiles that hide our pain
But the invitations open
To every heart that's been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

If the invitations open
To every heart that has been broken
Maybe then we close the curtain
On our stained glass masquerade

Is there anyone that fails?
Is there anyone that falls?
Am I the only one in church today, feeling so small?
Somewhere between the hot and the cold
Somewhere between the new and the old
Somewhere between who I am and who I used to be
Somewhere in the middle, you'll find me

Somewhere between the wrong and the right
Somewhere between the darkness and the light
Somewhere between who I was and who you're making me
Somewhere in the middle, you'll find me

Just how close can I get, lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common sense
Deep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middle
With eyes wide open to the differences, the god we want and the god who is
But will we trade our dreams for his or are we caught in the middle
Are we caught in the middle
Somewhere between my heart and my hands
Somewhere between my faith and my plans
Somewhere between the safety of the boat and the crashing waves
Somewhere between a whisper and a roar
Somewhere between the altar and the door
Somewhere between contented peace and always wanting more
Somewhere in the middle you'll find me

Just how close can I get, lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common sense
Deep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middle
With eyes wide open to the differences, the god we want and the god who is
But will we trade our dreams for his or are we caught in the middle

Lord, I feel you in this place and I know you're by my side
Loving me even on these nights, when I'm caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
She is running
A hundred miles an hour
In the wrong direction
She is trying
But the canyons ever widening
In the depths of her cold heart
So she sets out on another misadventure just to find
She's another two years older and she's three more steps behind

Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?
Or does anybody even know she's going down today?
Under the shadow of our steeple
With all the lost and lonely people
Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me
Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?

She is yearning
For shelter and affection
That she never found at home
She is searching
For a hero to ride in,
To ride in and save the day
And then walks in her prince charming
And he knows just what to say
A momentary lapse of reason
And she gives herself away

Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?
Or does anybody even know she's going down today?
Under the shadow of our steeple
With all the lost and lonely people
Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me
Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?

If judgment looms under every steeple
If lofty glances from lofty people
Who can't see past her scarlet letter
And we never even met her

If judgment looms under every steeple
If lofty glances from lofty people
Who can't see past her scarlet letter
And we never even met her
Never even met her

Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?
Or does anybody even know she's going down today?
Under the shadow of our steeple
With all the lost and lonely people
Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me
Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?

Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?
Or does anybody even know she's going down today?
Under the shadow of our steeple
With all the lost and lonely people
Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me
Does anybody hear her?
Can anybody see?

He is running a hundred miles an hour in the wrong direction
To know you is never worry for my life, and
To know you is to never to give in or compromise
To know you is to want to tell the world about you
'Cause I can't live without you

To know you is to hear your voice when you are calling
To know you is to catch my brother when he is falling
To know you is to feel the pain of the broken hearted
'Cause they can't live with out you.

More than my next breath
More than life or death
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies
To know you is to want to know you more
To know you is to want to know you more

To know you is to ache for more than ordinary
To know you is to look beyond the temporary
To know you is believing that you will be enough
'Cause there is no life without you

More than my next breath
More than life or death
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies
To know you is to want to know you more
To know you is to want to know you more

All this life could offer me, could not compare to you
Compare to you
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you
Knowing you

More than my next breath
More than life or death
All reaching for, I live my life to know you more
I leave it all behind, you are all that satisfies
To know you is to want to know you more
To know you is to want to know you more

Compared to you
Compared to you
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you
Knowing you
And I count it all as lost, compared to knowing you
Knowing you
I try to find a new way to tell You
Some way to show You what You mean to me
There's nothing new
I exhaust myself searching
The world just keeps turning
What else can I do
'Cause I find myself empty and

Face down
Having nothing else to cling to
But need of love that only You can give
Face down
Where I know that I belong
And I pray with grace that this world sees in me
Someone humbled and broken at Your feet

I stand amazed, see the work of Your hands
Still I don't understand why You would rescue me
An empty cross
Where You suffered and bled
Overcoming my death
Recreating me
With this freedom I will be

Face down
Having nothing else to cling to
But need of love that only You can give
Face down
Where I know that I belong
And I pray with grace that this world sees in me
Someone humbled and broken at Your feet

So I'm asking for Your help
Just can't do this by myself
After all, this life's for You and not for me
Through Your mercy now I see
Brokenness is what I need
So I'll stay right here at Your feet
Right here at Your feet and

Face down
Having nothing else to cling to
But need of love that only You can give
Face down
Where I know that I belong
And I pray with grace that this world sees in me
Someone humbled and broken at Your feet
Oh, humbled and broken at Your feet
At Your feet
I will sing to the Lord
And I will lift my voice
For You have heard my cry

I will sing to the Lord
And I will lift my hands
For You have brought me out of the pit
For You have brought me out of the pit

And I'll sing glory, hallelujah
I lift Your name on high
And I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy
I'll praise You with the dance
It hasn't always been this way
I remember brighter days
Before the dark ones came
Stole my mind
Wrapped my soul in chains

Now I live among the dead
Fighting voices in my head
Hoping someone hears me crying in the night
And carries me away

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

Morning breaks another day
Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?
The dark ones shriek
They scream his name
Is this the one they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

And as the God man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
And darkness cannot hide

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

You are free
You are free
You are free
We are free
We are free
Jesus set us free
Lord I want to feel with Your heart
And see the world through Your eyes
I want to be Your hands and feet
I want to live a life that leads

[Chorus]
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus
In the darkest night
Oh, ready yourselves
Oh, ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise
Until the whole world hears 
Lord we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Lord let Your sleeping giant arise
Catch the demons by surprise
Holy nation sanctified
Let this be our battle cry

[Chorus]

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears
Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears

Want to be Your hands and feet
Want to be a life that leads
To see You set the captive free
Until the whole world hears
And I pray that they will see more of You and less of me
Lord I want my life to be the song You sing
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting Your name up for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!

Whoa oh oh! 
Whoa oh oh! 
We'll sing until 
The whole world hears!
You are holy in this place
You are worthy of my praise and we worship You
Jesus we worship You

You're the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
You're the Master of the Universe
You're the Ruler of all Nations
And we sing to You, sing to You

When You call my name, I'll run to You
I'll do anything You ask me to
Falling on my knees I worship You, my Lord
We give You GLORY

Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia
Alle Alleluia

A corner office was his dream
More like a prison now it seems
Somewhere on the corporate climb
He left his warrior behind
Now he's just a worker at a daily grind
Steals his years and numbs his mind
His strength is fading, his dreams are blind
This is not the life he had in mind

She lies awake 'cause he's up all night
Staring at a screen that tells him lies
That the grass is greener on the other side
So she's at the gym fighting off the years
To be young again and calm her fears
That she'll never be enough for him
Just as a young man catches her eye

Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars
With their cell phones and the closed doors
It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
But they're all alone together
In the house of their dreams
Little sister, she's a sixteen-year-old princess
Lost somewhere between the swing set
And her brand new crush's chariot awaits
And big brother's rooms glowing with trophies that shout his name
But he'd trade all his high school fame
For some backyard catch with his hero again

But they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars
With their cell phones and the closed doors
It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
But they're all alone together
In the house of their dreams

So now they're all dressed up in Sunday best
Sit up straight just like the rest
And they sing the songs of peace and rest that Jesus freely gives
And then their kids look up as daddy stands
And he takes his bride with trembling hands
Brother kneels at his father's side as princess looks in the mother's eyes
Their tears tear down the walls as daddy prays

We're trapped in our own worlds and our own wars
With our cell phones and our closed doors
God, only You can save our family
And on this Rock, we'll build
On this Rock, we'll build
The house of our dreams
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

Standing at the water's edge
I dropped my dreams when I dropped my nets
No hesitation, no regrets
I followed You
But that was then
And this is now

You washed my feet and You changed my name
I swore I'd never be the same
But just like the tides, I guess people change
'Cause that was then
And this is now

I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let You down
I want to be that man again
But that was then
And this is now (Whoa)
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

I watched the blind man lift his head
And look his Savior in the eyes
I heard a dead man take a breath
Dropped to my knees as I watched him rise
And I felt the sea beneath my feet
As I stepped out on the angry waves
But You saw the storm raging within
You reached out and calmed me then
But this is now

I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let You down
I want to be that man again
But that was then
And this is now

Just when I thought my sin has closed the door
I see my Savior standing on the shore
With arms wide open
Just like the first time You called my name
You said that was then
And this is now

My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown
When you couldn't come to me, my love came down
So take My hand, I'll lead you out
'Cause that was then
And this is now

My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown
You couldn't come to me so my love came down
Take my hand, I'll lead you out
You'll never be that man again
'Cause that was then
And this is now (Whoa)
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
The skies don't seem to be as dark as usual
The stars seem brighter than they've been before
Deep within I feel my soul a stirring
As though my hope has been restored
The shepherds say they've heard the voice of angels
Confirming rumors spread across the land
That a child protected well from Herod's anger
Is our father's son, and the son of man

Love is raining down on the world tonight
There's a presence here I can tell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel
He's the savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts he will dwell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel

I feel compelled to tell all who will listen
That peace on earth is not so out of reach
If we can find grace, mercy and forgiveness
He has come to save, he is all of these

Love is raining down on the world tonight
There's a presence here I can tell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel
He's the savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts he will dwell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel

Love is raining down on the world tonight
There's a presence here I can tell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel
He's the savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts he will dwell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us

You're the savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts you will dwell
You are in us, you are for us
You are with us
Emmanuel
Here at Your feet, I lay my past down
My wanderings, all my mistakes down
And I am free

Here at Your feet, I lay this day down
Not in my strength, but in Yours I've found
All I need, You're all I need

Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet
Oh, to dwell and never leave
Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet
There is nowhere else for me
There is nowhere else for me

Here at Your feet, I lay my future down
All of my dreams, I give to You now
And I find peace, I find peace
Here at Your feet, I lay my life down
For You my King, You're all I want now
And my soul sings!

'Cause I am free (here at Your feet)
All I need (is at Your feet)
I find peace
We're at Your feet
We're at Your feet

And I am free (here at Your feet)
All I need (is at Your feet)
I find peace
We're at Your feet
We're at Your feet
We're at Your feet
We're at Your feet

Here at Your feet
I lay my life down
Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,
Leave it all behind,

I have what you need,
But you keep on searchin',
I've done all the work,
But you keep on workin',
When you're runnin' on empty,
And you can't find the remedy,
Just come to the well.

You can spend your whole life,
Chasin' what's missing,
But that empty inside,
It just ain't gonna listen.
When nothing can satisfy,
And the world leaves you high and dry,
Just come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

So bring me your heart
No matter how broken,
Just come as you are,
When your last prayer is spoken,
Just rest in my arms a while,
You'll feel the change my child,
When you come to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

Yeah
Leave it all behind

The world will try, but it can never fill, leave it all behind

And now that you're full,
Of love beyond measure,
Your joy's gonna flow,
Like a stream in the desert,
Soon all the world will see that living water is found in me,
'Cause you came to the well

And all who thirst will thirst no more,
And all who search will find what their souls long for,
The world will try, but it can never fill,
So leave it all behind, and come to the well

Leave it all behind, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind, leave it all behind
God, help me get away
Break the chains and set me free
From the other side of me
I am my own worst enemy

I caught a glimpse in my rearview mirror
Of an old familiar face
Blurry image coming in clearer
Of a past I can't erase
I could've sworn I put him in the ground
But looks like he's found his way out

God, help me get away
Break the chains and set me free
From the other side of me
I can't fight this fight alone
I'll never make it on my own
Lord Jesus, rescue me
From my own worst enemy

I'll take a step and it's right behind me
Always fighting for control
There's a war that's raging inside me
I feel the battle for my soul
It's like my shadow is dragging me around
And You are my only way out

God, help me get away
Break the chains and set me free
From the other side of me
I can't fight this fight alone
I'll never make it on my own
Lord Jesus, rescue me
From my own worst enemy

Lord, help me feed the life I'm trying to live
And starve the life I'm trying to leave
Help me believe the old is dead and gone
And I am a new creation

God, help me get away
Break the chains and set me free
From the other side of me
I can't fight this fight alone
I'll never make it on my own
Lord Jesus, rescue me
From my own worst enemy
From my own worst enemy
Lord, the worship we bring
Is more than songs that we sing
It's a reflection of our ever-changing lives
The best we have to offer

We don't just lift up our hands
Lord, we lift up our lives
For we know that You are worthy of our praise
To You our life songs raise
Rescued from darkness
We are walking in marvelous light
For we are children of the King
Sing

You are worthy of our honor
Glory, praise and power
King of the nations
You are Holy God Almighty
Clothed in brilliant majesty
Father, Spirit, Jesus

It was a day
Just like any other day
I was a boy
Just like every other boy

But when the girl
Unlike any I had seen
It's like she stepped out of a dream
And into my world
Could have been the summer wind
Playing with her hair
As the sun danced in her eyes
We were standing there

She smiled I forgot my name
'Cause all I was thinking
Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life

You're the proof that the Father answers prayers
'Cause somehow someway
You and I are standing here

With the sacred promise
And a ring that says it all
I've just begun to fall
From the deepest part of me I say I do

Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life
After all the changing seasons
Have turned to years
The crowns are gone
And the suns have faded

I'd still be here
Holding you
When thanking heaven
For my angel
Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying
That an angel will love me
An angel will love me

Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling
Asking heaven above me
For an angel to love me
The rest of my life
Did you hear of the city on the hill
Said one old man to the other
It once shined bright, and it would be shining still
But they all started turning on each other

You see the poets thought the dancers were shallow
And the soldiers thought the poets were weak
And the elders saw the young ones as foolish
And the rich man never heard the poor man speak

But one by one, they ran away
With their made up minds to leave it all behind
And the light began to fade
In the City on the Hill, the City on the Hill

Each one thought that they knew better
But they were different by design
Instead of standing strong together
They let their differences divide

And one by one, they ran away
With their made up minds to leave it all behind
And the light began to fade
In the City on the Hill, the City on the Hill

And the world is searching still

But it was the rhythm of the dancers
That gave the poets life
It was the spirit of the poets
That gave the soldiers strength to fight
It was fire of the young ones
It was the wisdom of the old
It was the story of the poor man
That needed to be told

It is the rhythm of the dancers
That gives the poets life
It is the spirit of the poets
That gives the soldiers strength to fight
It is fire of the young ones
It is the wisdom of the old
It is the story of the poor man
That's needing to be told

But one by one will we run away
With our made up minds to leave it all behind
As the light begins to fade in the City on the Hill

One by one will we run away
With our made up minds to leave it all behind
As the light begins to fade in the City on the Hill
The city on the hill

(Come home)
And the Father's calling still
(Come home)
To the city on the hill
(Come home)
I was a wandering soul
Traveling a well worn road
A sinner so far from home
No second chance in sight
I heard You call my name
I felt You lift my shame
And I made a vow that day
That I'd spend the rest of my life

Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus

Sin tries to make you hide
Whispers that same old lie
Keep all your pain inside
'Cause no one will understand
The last thing this lost world needs
Is someone I'm trying to be
Truth that has set me free
Is that I'm just a broken man

Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus

When all is said and done
When my last song's been sung
I stand face to face with the One
Who gave all for me
May all I have to show
Be all that mattered most
Making Your great name known
Let this be my only legacy
Loving my Jesus
Showing my scars
Telling my story of how mercy
Can reach You where You are
And I pray the whole world hears
The cry of my heart
Is to see all the ones I love
Oh, all the ones I love
Loving my Jesus
Living on my own, thinking for myself
Castles in the sand, temporary wealth
Now the walls are falling down
Now the storms are closing in
And here I am again
Jesus, hold me now
I need to feel You in this place
To know You're by my side
And hear Your voice tonight
Jesus, hold me now
I long for Your embrace
I'm beat and broken down
I can't find my way out
Jesus, hold me now

Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day
Of reaping what I've sown, living with my shame
Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made
One day you're a prince, and the next day you're a slave

Lord, I just looked up today
And realized how far away I am from where You are
I don't know what else to pray
Broken at Your feet I lay
The life I've torn apart
Jesus, hold me now
Jesus, hold me now
Jesus, hold me now
Jesus, hold me now
I want to know you
Cause only you can satisfy
I long to touch you
Only you can heal my life
Heal my life

I want to know you
Cause only you can satisfy
I long to touch you
Only you can heal my life
Heal my life

I can't find peace in the things I do
I need to see your kingdom
I can't find peace as I strive for you
I need to see your face

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay
Say you'll stay

I want to know you
Cause only you can satisfy
I long to touch you
Only you can heal my life
Heal my life

I can't find peace in the things I do
I need to see your kingdom
I can't find peace as I strive for you
I need to see your face

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay

Hold me in your arms and never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay
Say you'll stay

Hold me in your arms
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay
Ezekiel stared down into the valley
Filled with dry bones baking in the sun
Remains that used to be a mighty army
To him it looked like their fighting days were done

But driven by a calling on his life
He spoke Gods words the bones began to shake
He stared wide-eyed as the flesh began to form
And as he prophesied to the wind
The soldiers began to wake

And the Lord sent His wind into the valley
And breathed the breath of life into their souls
And raised them again a mighty army
For soon these arisen warriors will battle again
For they have been filled with the Spirit Wind
Whoa whoa whoa

A pastor stands before his congregation
Once a mighty army for the Lord
But now he stares into the lifeless eyes
Believers leading carnal lives
He wonders what they're fighting for
But driven by a calling on his life
He spoke Gods word like had done a hundred times before
But this time he comes broken and weeping
With tears of a broken heart
And he cries out to the Lord

Oh Lord send Your wind into this valley
And breathe the breath of life into their souls
And raise them again a mighty army
For soon these arisen warriors will battle again
For they have been filled with the Spirit Wind
Whoa whoa whoa

Holy Spirit breathe on me
Breathe Your life in me

Holy Spirit breathe on me
Breathe Your life in me

Holy Spirit breathe on me
Breathe Your life in me

Holy Spirit breathe on me
Breathe Your life in me

Oh Lord send Your wind into this valley
And breathe the breath of life into our souls
And raise us again a mighty army
For soon these arisen warriors will battle again
For we have been filled with the Spirit Wind
Whoa whoa whoa

Oh Lord we need You now
Breathe Your life into us
Lord we need You now
Our churches and our families
Oh Lord we need You now
Breathe life into this dry and weary land
Raise us up again
Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ the savior is born
 
With the angels let us sing
Hallelujah to the king
Christ the savior is born
Christ the savior is born
Sixteen finds me
Blowing out candles and making wishes
And all around me
Is everyone but the one I'm wishing for
And he sent me flowers
And gift-wrapped excuses
From a daddy whose daughter
Wants to see him again

And I know, I know
It's just another birthday
But I guess I thought
This would be the one
When he would call me, see me
Hold me and free me
But it's just another birthday

And I'll be fine
I'll be fine

Nineteen finds me
And I'm wild-eyed and wide open
I gave myself away to love
But backseat promises fade like a mist
I'm screaming at the midnight air
Everyone hears me but I don't care
My heart's clenched just like a fist
'Cause, people, I didn't ask for any of this
And I'm not fine
I'm not fine

In the company of strangers
In a cold and sterile room
All alone with a child inside me
And I don't know what to do
Jesus, can You hear me
Come and heal my brokenness
Put the pieces back together
And be a Father to the fatherless
Twenty-one finds me
Blowing out candles and making wishes
And all around me
My barefoot princess twirls and sings
It's so amazing
Looking back at all God's brought us through
You are my happy birthday
And you were born to break the chains

Now I know, I know
It's not just another birthday
'Cause I'm here, she's here
And look how far we've come
Since you've called me, saw me
Held me and freed me
Thank you, Lord, for another birthday
And we'll be fine
We'll be fine
I'm the man with all I've wanted
All the toys and playing games
I am the one who pours your coffee
Corner booth each Saturday

I am your daughter's favorite teacher
I'm the leader of the band
I sit behind you in the bleachers
I am every man

I'm the coach of every winning team
And still a loser in my mind
I am the soldier in the airport
Facing giants one more time

I am the woman shamed and haunted
By the cry of unborn life
I am every broken man
Nervous child, lonely wife

Is there hope for every man?
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
Is there hope for every man?

Is there love that never dies
Is there peace in troubled times
Someone help me understand
Is there hope for every man?

It seems there's just so many roads to travel
It's hard to tell where they will lead
My life is scarred, my dreams unraveled
Now I am scared to take the lead

If I could find someone to follow
Who knows my pain and feels the way
The uncertainty of my tomorrow
The guilt and pain of yesterday

Is there hope for every man?
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
Is there hope for every man?

Is there love that never dies
Is there peace in troubled times
Someone help me understand
Is there hope for every man?

There is hope for every man
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
There is hope for every man

There is love that never dies
There is peace in troubled times
Will we help them understand
Jesus is hope for every man

There is hope for every man
A solid place where we can stand
In this dry and weary land
There is hope for every man

There is love that never dies
There is peace in troubled times
Will we help them understand
Jesus is hope for every man
I will love You, Lord always
Not just for the things You've done for me 
And I will praise You all my days
Not just for the change You've made in me
I'll praise you for You are holy, Lord
And I'll lift my hands, but You are worthy of so much more

[Chorus]
For You are awesome, God of the Nations, 
Lion of Judah, Rock of the Ages, Alpha, Omega
You're worthy of all praise
More that these hands I'll raise 
I'll live a life of praise

I will serve You Lord, always for You are my strength
When I am weak 
I will never be afraid for You are my rock and You protect me
But I'll praise You for You are holy, Lord
And I'll lift my hands, but You are worthy of so much more
Oh, my soul
Oh, how you worry
Oh, how you're weary, from fearing you lost control
This was the one thing, you didn't see coming
And no one would blame you, though
If you cried in private
If you tried to hide it away, so no one knows
No one will see, if you stop believing

Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear has to face the God you know
One more day, He will make a way
Let Him show you how, you can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone

Here and now
You can be honest
I won't try to promise that someday it all works out
'Cause this is the valley
And even now, He is breathing on your dry bones
And there will be dancing
There will be beauty where beauty was ash and stone
This much I know

Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear has to face the God you know
One more day, He will make a way
Let Him show you how, you can lay this down

I'm not strong enough, I can't take anymore
(You can lay it down, you can lay it down)
And my shipwrecked faith will never get me to shore
(You can lay it down, you can lay it down)
Can He find me here
Can He keep me from going under

Oh, my soul
You're not alone
There's a place where fear has to face the God you know
One more day, He will make a way
Let Him show you how, you can lay this down
'Cause you're not alone
Oh, my soul, you're not alone
One day when Heaven was filled with His praises
One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He
Word became flesh and the light shined among us
His glory revealed
Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose, over death He had conquered
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
From rising again
Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine
Wonderful day, my Beloved One bringing
My Savior Jesus is mine

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Glorious day
Oh glorious day
Hold it all together
Everybody needs you strong
But life hits you out of nowhere
And barely leaves you holding on

And when you're tired of fighting
Chained by your control
There's freedom in surrender
Lay it down and let it go

So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away
You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held
Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place
I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held
Just be held, just be held

If your eyes are on the storm
You'll wonder if I love you still
But if your eyes are on the cross
You'll know I always have and I always will

And not a tear is wasted
In time, you'll understand
I'm painting beauty with the ashes
Your life is in My hands

So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away
You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held
Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place
I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held
Just be held, just be held

Lift your hands, lift your eyes
In the storm is where you'll find Me
And where you are, I'll hold your heart
I'll hold your heart
Come to Me, find your rest
In the arms of the God who won't let go

So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away
You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held
Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place
I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held
(Stop holding on and just be held)
Just be held, just be held
Just be held, just be held
Oh little town of Bethlehem
Looks like another silent night
Above your deep and dreamless sleep
A giant star lights up the sky
And while you're lying in the dark
There shines an everlasting light
For the King has left his throne
And is sleeping in a manger tonight

Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
For God became a man
And stepped into your world today
Oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping

Oh little town of Jerusalem
Looks like another silent night
The Father gave his only Son
The Way, The Truth, the Life had come
But there was no room for Him in the world he came to save

Jerusalem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
The Savior of the world is dying on your cross today
Jerusalem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its King
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
United States of America
Looks like another silent night
As we're sung to sleep by philosophies
That save the trees and kill the children
And while we're lying in the dark
There's a shout heard 'cross the eastern sky
For the Bridegroom has returned
And has carried His bride away in the night
America, what will we miss while we are sleeping
Will Jesus come again
And leave us slumbering where we lay
America will we go down in history
As a nation with no room for its King
Will we be sleeping
Will we be sleeping
One more mother with a broken heart
One more family is torn apart
One more orphan out in the cold
One more fear that takes control
One more tangled in the same old lies
One more shackled to the same old highs
One more scared of what tomorrow brings
And one more chasing yesterday

Lord, let Your kingdom come

Who can right every wrong
You are the only One
Who can calm every storm
You are the only One
You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer
Lord of all
You are the only One

One more skeptic to believe
One more prisoner has been set free
One more longs to be Your hands and feet
One more standing for the least of these
One more praying in the morning light
One more shining in the darkest night
One more life worth fighting for
No greater love worth dying for

Lord, let Your kingdom come
Lord, let Your will be done

Who can right every wrong
You are the only One
Who can calm every storm
You are the only One
You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer
Lord of all
You are the only One
You are the only One

I want to know You more
I want to make You known
I want this world to see
That You're alive in me
Jesus, You're the only One

Who can right every wrong
You are the only One
Who can calm every storm
You are the only One
You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer
Lord of all
You are the only One (Father, Savior, Spirit)
You are the only One (Redeemer, Lord of all)
You are the only One
One name holds weight above them all
His fame outlasts the earth He formed
His praise resounds beyond the stars
And echoes in our hearts
The greatest One of all

His face shines brighter than the sun
His grace as boundless as His love
He reigns with healing in His wings
The King above all kings
The greatest One of all

Lift up our eyes, see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Seated on high, the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Find hope when all the world seems lost
Behold the triumph of the cross
His power has trampled death and grave
Our life found in His name
The greatest name of all

Lift up our eyes, see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Seated on high, the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

The earth will shake and tremble before Him
Chains will break as Heaven and Earth sing
Holy is the name
Holy is the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

The earth will shake and tremble before Him
Chains will break as Heaven and Earth sing
Holy is the name
Holy is the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

Lift up our eyes, see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Seated on high, the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other name
There is no other name
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus
Careless, I am reckless
I'm a wrong way traveling, slowly unraveling, shell of a man
Burn out, I'm so numb now
That the fire's just an ember way down in the corner, of my cold, cold heart

Lord this time, I'll make it right
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come and my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Here at the altar
Oh my world so black and white
How could I ever falter
What you've show me to be right

Lord this time (Lord this time)
I'll make it right (make it right)
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come, but my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

I'm trying so hard, to stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are
Lord who You are in me

Jesus I'm trying so hard
To stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are
Lord who You are in me, Oh Lord I

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Try (trying so hard)
Like so many times before (try so hard)
Lord I want to feel your heart
And see the world through your eyes
I want to be your hands and feet
I want to live a life that leads
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Lord let your sleeping giant arise
Catch the demons by surprise
Holy nation sanctified
Let this be our battle cry

Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Want to be your hands and feet
Want to be a life that leads
To see you set the captive free
Until the whole world hears
And I pray that they will see more of you and less of me
Lord I want my life to be the song You sing
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting your name up for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears
We'll sing until the whole world hears
For the longest time, I believed the lie
That I'm not a strong enough believer
To be the friend that can take your hand
And lead you straight to Jesus
I'm waiting on the preachers, singers, and the teachers
To string the perfect words together
But every single time I have to say goodbye
I wonder will this be the last time

I can't call myself your friend and walk away

When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth
When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love
I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand
I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend
Let my life and my words be the proof
I'm gonna love you with the truth (Oh)
Gonna love you with the truth (Oh)

Yes, God is love, but God is just
And we are separated in our darkness
So God let Him who knew no sin
To become sin to make us right with Him
It's not about religion or earning God's forgiveness
Or magic prayers or new behaviour
It's all about your heart, He'll meet you where you are
Turn from your sin and trust in Christ as Lord

Jesus is the truth, the life, the way

When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth
When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love
I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand
I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend
Let my life and my words be the proof
I'm gonna love you with the truth (Oh)
Gonna love you with the truth (Oh)

How I've prayed for this moment, that you would finally see
That God is more than religion, a stained-glass fantasy
And how I've prayed for the courage, for my silent faith to speak
Or that God would just send you a better friend than me

When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth
When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love
I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand
I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend
Let my life and my words be the proof
I'm gonna love you with the truth (Oh)
Gonna love you with the truth (Oh)

Oh
Oh
Hear our cry, Lord we pray,
Our faces down, our hands are raised,
You called us out, we turned away, we've turned away.

With ship wrecked faith, idols rise,
We do what is right, in our own eyes,
Our children now, will pay the price,
We need Your light, Lord, shine Your light.

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now,
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out.

All our hearts, all our strength,
With all our minds, we're at Your fate,
May Your Kingdom come, in our hearts and lives,
Let Your Church arise, let Your Church arise!

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now,
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out

If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now,
We're are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out,
If we've ever needed You, Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now,
We are desperate for Your hand, we're reachin' out, we're reachin' out

We need You now
Revive us now
We need You now
She's on her own, two girls at home
Thirteen years just up and walked away
And left her all alone
With bills to pay and mouths to feed
And every day she's taking care of everybody else's needs

But she's finding her strength in the One love that won't ever leave her
So she works and she prays and she loves and she stays 'cause they need her

These are the heroes, just ordinary people
Laying down their lives like angels in disguise
They're weak but always willing
They dare to do the hard things
And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes
You'll find the heroes
You'll find the heroes

He walks the halls, against the flow
He sees his high school as his mission field
He's broken 'cause he knows
The hopeless road that they are taking
The empty feelings they are chasing only lead to futures wasted
So he's willing to stand alone

He lives what he believes when they all say it's not worth believing
Every night on his knees, he prays God, won't You please help me reach them?

These are the heroes, just ordinary people
Laying down their lives like angels in disguise
They're weak but always willing
They dare to do the hard things
And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes
You'll find the heroes
You'll find the heroes

You may never know their names
But they're moving mountains just the same
Instead of searching for the spotlight
They'll follow Jesus into the darkest night
Heroes, these are the heroes (These are the heroes)

These are the heroes, just ordinary people
Laying down their lives (Laying down their lives)
Like angels in disguise (Like angels in disguise)
They're weak but always willing
They dare to do the hard things (Dare to do the hard things)
And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes
You'll find the heroes (In the board room with a Bible)
You'll find the heroes (In the classroom praying for revival)
You'll find the heroes (In third world countries, in downtown missions)
You'll find the heroes
Empty hands held high
Such small sacrifice
Now joined with my life
I sing in vain tonight
May the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to you

Let my lifesong sing to you
Let my lifesong sing to you
I want to sign your name
To the end of this day
Lord led my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to you

Lord I give my life
A living sacrifice
To reach a world in need
To be your hands and feet
So may the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to you

Let my lifesong sing to you
Let my lifesong sing to you
I want to sign your name
To the end of this day
Lord led my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to you

Hallelujah, Hallelujah let my lifesong sing to you
Hallelujah, Hallelujah let my lifesong sing to you
Hallelujah, Hallelujah let my lifesong sing to you

Let my lifesong sing to you
Let my lifesong sing to you
I want to sign your name
To the end of this day
Lord led my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to you

Let my lifesong sing to you
Let my lifesong sing to you
I want to sign your name
To the end of this day
Lord led my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to you
I came to You with my heart in pieces
And found the God with healing in His hands
I turned to You, put everything behind me
And found the God who makes all things new
I looked to You, drowning in my questions
And found the God who holds all wisdom
And I trusted You and stepped out on the ocean
You caught my hand among the waves
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take
You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows
And found a God who relentlessly pursues
I hid from You, haunted by my failure
And found the God whose grace still covers me
I fell on You when I was at my weakest
And found the God, the lifter of my head
And I've worshiped You
And felt You right beside me
You're the reason that I sing
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take
You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

In my worry, God You are my stillness
In my searching, God You are my answers
In my blindness, God You are my vision
In my bondage, God You are my freedom
In my weakness, God You are my power
You're the reason that I sing
'Cause You're the God of all my days

Each step I take
You make a way
And I will give You all my praise
My seasons change, You stay the same
You're the God of all my days

In my blindness, God You are my vision
And in my bondage, God You are my freedom
All my days
Lord, I lift my friend to You, I've done all that I know to do
I lift my friend to You
Complicated circumstances have clouded his view
Lord, I lift my friend up to You

I fear that I won't have the words that he needs to hear
I pray for Your wisdom, oh God, and a heart that's sincere
Lord, I lift my friend up to You

Lord, I lift my friend to You
My best friend in the world, I know he means much more to You
I want so much to help him, but this is something he has to do
And Lord, I lift my friend up to You

'Cause there's a way that seems so right to him
But You know where that leads
He's becoming a puppet of the world, too blind to see the strings
Lord, I lift my friend up to You
My friend up to You

Lord, I lift my friend to You, I've done all that I know to do
I lift my friend to You
The love of her life is drifting away
Their losing the fight for another day
The life that she's known is falling apart
A fatherless home, a child's broken heart
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
She's desperate for hope
Darkness clouding her view
She's looking to you

Just love her like Jesus
Carry her to him
His yoke is easy
His burden is light
You don't need the answers
To all of life's questions
Just know that He loves her
Stay by her side
And love her like Jesus
Love her like Jesus

The gifts lie in wait in a room painted blue
A little blessing from heaven will be there soon
Hope fades into night,
Blue skies turn into gray
As the little one slips away
You're holding her hand
You're straining for words
You're trying to make sense of it all
They're desperate for hope
Darkness clouding their view
They're looking to you

Just love her like Jesus
Carry her to him
His yoke is easy
His burden is light
You don't need the answers
To all of life's questions
Just know that He loves her
Stay by her side
And love her like Jesus
Love her like Jesus

Lord of all creation holds our life in His hand
The God of all the nations holds our lives in His hands
The rock of our salvation holds our lives in His hands
He cares for them just as He cares for you.

So love them like Jesus
Love them like Jesus
You don't need the answers
To all of life's questions
Just know that He loves them
Stay by their side

Love them like Jesus
Love them like Jesus
Love them like Jesus
Love them like Jesus
Who am I, that the lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt?
Who am I, that the bright and morning star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wandering heart?

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love
And watch me rise again?
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain
And calm the storm in me?

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

Not because of who I am
But because of what you've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who you are

I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still you hear me when I'm calling
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
And you've told me who I am
I am yours

I am yours
I am yours
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear?
'Cause I am yours
I am yours
Living on my own, thinking for myself
Castles in the sand, temporary wealth
Walls are falling down, storms are closing in
Tears have filled my eyes, here I am again

And I've held out as long as I can
And now I'm letting go and holding out my hand

Daddy, here I am again, 
Will you take me back tonight
I went and made the world my friend, 
And it left me high and dry
I drag Your name back through the mud
That You first found me in
Not worthy to be called Your son
Is this to be my end?
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again
Curse this morning sun, drags me in to one more day
Of reaping what I've sown, of living with my shame
Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made
Where one day you're a prince, the next day your a slave

And I've held out as long as I can
And now I'm letting go and holding out my hand

Daddy, here I am again, 
Will you take me back tonight
I went and made the world my friend, 
And it left me high and dry
I drag Your name back through the mud
That You first found me in
Not worthy to be called Your son
Is this to be my end?
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again

And I've held out as long as I can
And NOW I'm letting go and holding out my hand

Daddy, here I am again, 
Will you take me back tonight
I went and made the world my friend, 
And it left me high and dry
I drag Your name back through the mud
That You first found me in
Not worthy to be called Your son
Is this to be my end?
Daddy, here I am
Here I am again
In the morning when I rise
Jesus be my eyes
Before the day rushes in
With You is where I begin
As You sing over me with Your love
I will sing praise for all You have done
Fill my heart as I hunger for You
Flood my mind with Your wisdom, Your mercy, Your truth
Father, make me a river
Come living water
Flow through me
You are the One that I thirst for
So come living water
Flow through me

Guide every step I take
Lord, let me not wander away
Father, fill every word I speak
With the same grace that You've given me
Touch the world with my hands, they are Yours
Let my love show the lost that You are the Lord

Father, make me a river
Come living water
Flow through me
You are the One that I thirst for
So come living water
Flow through me

Make me a river
Make me a river

Let the river flow
Let the river flow

Father, make me a river
Come living water
Flow through me
You are the One that I thirst for
So come living water
Flow through me

Let the river flow (Father, make me a river)
Let the river flow (Living water, flow through me)
Let the river flow (Father, make me a river)
Let the river flow (Living water, flow through me)

Father, make me a river
Come living water
Flow through me
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world the savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy (repeat the sounding joy)
Repeat the sounding joy (repeat the sounding joy)
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love (wonders of his love)
And wonders of his love (wonders of his love)
And wonders, wonders of his love
And wonders, wonders of his love
And wonders, wonders of his love

Joy to the world 
The wonders of your love
The wonders of your love
Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star 
While angels sang to lowly shepherds
Three wise men seeking truth, they traveled from afar
Hoping to find the child from heaven
And falling on their knees they bow before the humble Prince of Peace

We bring an offering of worship to our King
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due (the honor that you're due)
O Lord, I bring an offering to you

The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love
There is no shadow in your presence
No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne
Before the Holy One of heaven
It's only by Your blood, it's only through Your mercy Lord, I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due (the honor that you're due)
O Lord, I bring an offering to you

I bring an offering of worship to my king
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due (the honor that you're due)
And O Lord, we bring an offering to you

We bring an offering to you
We are an offering to you (an offering, of praise we sing)
(An offering, to you) we are an offering to you, Jesus
(An offering, of praise we sing)
(An offering to you) (we are an offering to you)
We are an offering of worship to our king
No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due (the honor that you're due)
O Lord, we bring an offering to you
O Lord, we bring an offering
Jesus, my king (my king, my king) an offering to you 
An offering to you (praises that we sing) we bring an offering to you
(No one deserves) we are an offering to you
Oh, Lord, unto the King
I just looked up today and
Realized how far away I am from where You are
You gave me life worth dying for but
Between the altar and the door
I bought the lies that promised more
And here I go again

Oh
Oh

Lord, I know I let You down
But somehow, I will make You proud
I'll turn this sinking ship around
And make it back to You

But all my deeds and my good name
Are just dirty rags that tear and strain
To cover all my guilty stains
That You already washed away

'Cause all You've ever wanted,
All You've ever wanted
All You've ever wanted was my heart
Freedom's arms are open,
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
And all You wanted was my heart

I was chasing healing when I'd been made well
I was fighting battles when You conquered hell
Living free but from a prison cell
Lord, I lay it down today

So I'll stop living off of how I feel
And start standing on Your truth revealed
Jesus is my strength, my shield
And He will never fail me

'Cause all You've ever wanted,
All You've ever wanted
All You've ever wanted was my heart
Freedom's arms are open,
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
All You wanted was my heart

Oh
No more chains, I've been set free
Oh
No more fighting battles You've won for me
Oh
Now in Christ, I stand complete
Oh

All You've ever wanted,
All You've ever wanted
All You've ever wanted was my heart
(All You've ever wanted was my heart)
Freedom's arms are open,
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
And all You wanted was my heart

Oh
And all You wanted was my heart
Oh
All You ever wanted was my heart
Oh
And all You wanted was my heart
Oh
Oh little town of Bethlehem
Looks like another silent night
Above your deep and dreamless sleep
A giant star lights up the sky
And while you're lying in the dark
There shines an everlasting light
For the king has left his throne
And is sleeping in a manger tonight, tonight

Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
For God became a man
And stepped into your world today
Oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its king
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping

Oh little town of Jerusalem
Looks like another silent night
The father gave his only son
The way, the truth, the life had come
But there was no room for him in the world he came to save

Jerusalem, what you have missed while you were sleeping
The savior of the world is dying on your cross today
Jerusalem, you will go down in history
As a city with no room for its king
While you were sleeping
While you were sleeping
United States of America
Looks like another silent night
As we're sung to sleep by philosophies
That save the trees and kill the children
And while we're lying in the dark
There's a shout heard 'cross the eastern sky
For the bridegroom has returned
And has carried his bride away in the night, in the night
America, what will we miss while we are sleeping
Will Jesus come again
And leave us slumbering where we lay
America, will we go down in history
As a nation with no room for its king
Will we be sleeping
Will we be sleeping
United States of America
Looks like another silent night
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

On the morning of creation
Father, Son and the Spirit rise
As they set the world in motion
The morning of the first sunrise
A symphony of golden sunlight
Dancing in the Father's eyes
He gazes at His masterpiece
As all creation cries
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Man shakes the fist at heaven
The breath of God still in his lungs
A brokenhearted Father grieves
In love He sends His only Son
He was bruised for our transgressions
Crushed and buried in the ground
As the sunrise finds an empty tomb
The redeemed of God resound
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Holy quiet grips the night
The morning of the last sunrise
Broken slumber, blinding light
Nations tremble at the sight
The Son of Man just split the sky
Every saint and every scoffer
Every king and every pauper
At the name of Jesus all fall face down
From holy ground we'll rise
To meet the Bridegroom in the sky
From Earth to Heaven reigns the Son

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Here I am a sinner
Broken and in need of You
Take my life and wash my fears away
For You are the Great I AM
Rest assured, I feel Your hand
Holding me until the darkness clears
A Father to the fatherless
Redeemer of my soul
My Life is Yours forever
I want the world to know

Your mercy saved me
Mercy made me whole
Your mercy found me
Called me as Your own

Here I stand a child of Yours
Broken and in need of You
Break these chains and wash my guilt away
Healer of my brokenness
My weary soul will find its rest
You are my strength, the lifter of my head
You're greater than my yesterdays
You hold me close today
You're the Lord of my tomorrows
My heart will always say
You're greater than my yesterdays
You hold me close today
You're the Lord of my tomorrows
My heart will always say

You called me as Your own
You called me as Your own
Thank You for Your mercy
Thank You for Your mercy

You called me as Your own
Your own
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I once was lost, but now I'm found
So far away, but I'm home now
I once was lost, but now I'm found
And my lifesong sings

I once was blind, but now I see
I once was blind, but now I see
I don't know how, but when He touched me
I once was blind, but now I see

And now my lifesong sings
And now my lifesong sings
And now my lifesong sings

I once was dead, but now I live
I once was dead, but now I live
Now my life to You I give
Now my life to You I give
Now my life to You I give

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Let my lifesong sing to You
Oh what I would do to have
The kind of faith it takes
To climb out of this boat I'm in
Onto the crashing waves

To step out of my comfort zone
Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is
And He's holding out His hand

But the waves are calling out my name
And they laugh at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The waves they keep on telling me
Time and time again. "Boy, you'll never win!"
"You'll never win!"

But the voice of truth tells me a different story
The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!"
The voice of truth says, "This is for My glory"
Out of all the voices calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth

Oh what I would do to have
The kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant
With just a sling and a stone
Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors
Shaking in their armor
Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand

But the giant's calling out my name
And he laughs at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The giant keeps on telling me
Time and time again. "Boy you'll never win!"
"You'll never win!"

But the stone was just the right size
To put the giant on the ground
And the waves they don't seem so high
From on top of them lookin' down
I will soar with the wings of eagles
When  I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus
Singing over me

I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth
At the end of myself
I'm empty and dry
I have nothing to give
But surrender inside
Let down your nets
This is not the end
From now on, you'll be
Fishers of men

Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me

At the end of myself
Judgment calls out my name
I've been looking for love
But I'm swallowed by shame
Throw away all your stones
Find forgiveness in Me
Let Me be your new passion
My daughter, you're free

Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me

At the end of myself
I've done things my own way
This world gave up on me
Now its death I do pay
You know who I am
I'm sin's sacrifice
Today you will be
In paradise
Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me
Follow Me

Who is this man who calmed the seas
And who is this man who loves the least of these

I am the promised One
God gave His only Son
And those who believe
Will live eternally

At the end of yourself, just follow Me
If you lose everything, just follow Me
I will give you new life, just follow Me
Follow Me

If at the end of yourself, just follow Me
You may lose everything, just follow Me
I will give you new life, just follow Me
Follow Me
It hasn't always been this way
I remember brighter days
Before the dark ones came
Stole my mind
Wrapped my soul in chains

Now I live among the dead
Fighting voices in my head
Hoping someone hears me crying in the night
And carries me away

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free

Morning breaks another day
Finds me crying in the rain
All alone with my demons I am
Who is this man that comes my way?
The dark ones shriek
They scream his name
Is this the one they say will set the captives free?
Jesus, rescue me

Set me free of the chains holding me
Is anybody out there hearing me?
Set me free 

And as the god man passes by
He looks straight through my eyes
And darkness cannot hide

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

Do you want to be free?
Lift your chains
I hold the key
All power on heaven and earth belong to me

You are free
You are free
You are free
We are free
We are free
Jesus set us free
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angles 
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to thee be all glory given
Word of the father
Now in flesh appearing
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Come let us adore him
He is Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Come let us adore him (come let us adore him)
Come let us adore him

Lyrics
All my life I longed to be a hero
My sword raised high, running to the battle
I was gonna take giants down
Be a man you would write about
Deep in my chest is the heart of a warrior

So why am I still standing here?
Why am I still holding back from You?
I hear You call me out into deeper waters
But I settle on the shallow end
So why am I still standing here?

So afraid what it might cost to follow You
I'd walk by faith if I could get these feet to move
But I don't want to live that way
I don't want to look back someday
On a life that never stepped across the line

So why am I still standing here?
Why am I still holding back from You?
You've given me a faith that can move a mountain
But I'm still playing in the sand
Building little kingdoms that'll never stand
I hear You call me out into deeper waters
But I settle on the shallow end

I'm so tired of standing here
What if I gave everything to You?

What if I gave everything?
What if I stopped holding back from You?
Starting now, I'm stepping out onto deeper waters
What if I gave everything?
What if I stopped holding back from You?
Starting now, I'm stepping out onto deeper waters
I want to see some mountains move

Ready to give everything
Say goodbye to standing here
If all I had was one last breath
I'd spend it just to sing your praise
Just to say your name

If all I had was one last prayer
I'd pray it 'cause I know you're always listening

If I could live a thousand lives, bind the hands of time
I would spend every moment by your side, 'cause I

[Chorus:]
I know you're there, I know you see me
You're the air I breathe, you are the ground beneath me
I know you're there, I know you hear me
I can find you anywhere

If all I had was one more song to sing
I would raise a noise to make the heavens ring
If all I had was one last chance
I'd take it, I would stake it all on you

If I could rise up high
And catch a glimpse of every eye
I would make them believe what I feel inside, 'cause I

[Chorus]

If I could live a thousand lives and bind the hands of time ?
If I could rise up high and catch a glimpse of every eye ?

[Chorus]

I know you're there x3
You're there
God, You are my God
Earnestly I seek You, oh my soul
I thirst for You
My body aches in a dry and weary land
I've seen You in Your sanctuary
I beheld Your power and shouted glory
My soul is full, my lips will sing Your praise
Lift your voices

Let the sound of praise be heard
All the ends of Earth
Praise the Holy One
Sing the glory of His name
Every tongue proclaim
Praise the Holy One

You are my help, I sing
In the shadow of Your wings
My soul will cling
Your right hand holds me up
You are my king, You are my God
Lift your voices

I will sing for Your glory
For Your love is better than life
I will sing for Your glory
For Your love is better than life
Better than life
I was sure by now God you would have reached down
And wiped our tears away,
Stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen
That it's still raining
As the thunder rolls
I barely hear your whisper through the rain,
I'm with you
And as your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise
The God who gives and takes away.

[Chorus]
And I'll praise you in this storm
And I will lift my hands
That you are who you are
No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm

I remember when I stumbled in the wind
You heard my cry you raised me up again
My strength is almost gone how can I carry on
If I can't find you
And as the thunder rolls
I barely hear you whisper through the rain
I'm with you
And as your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise
The God who gives and takes away

[Chorus]

I lift my eyes unto the hills
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth
I lift my eyes unto the hills
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth

[Chorus]
I was sure by now, God you would have reached down
And wiped our tears away,
Stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen
That it's still raining
As the thunder rolls
I barely hear your whisper through the rain
I'm with you
And as your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise
The God who gives and takes away

And I'll praise you in this storm
And I will lift my hands
That you are who you are
No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm

I remember when I stumbled in the wind
You heard my cry you raised me up again
My strength is almost gone how can I carry on
If I can't find you
As the thunder rolls
I barely hear you whisper through the rain
I'm with you
And as your mercy falls
I raise my hands and praise
The God who gives and takes away

And I'll praise you in this storm
And I will lift my hands
That you are who you are
No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm

I lift my eyes unto the hills
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord
The maker of heaven and earth
I lift my eyes unto the hills
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord
The maker of heaven and earth

And I'll praise you in this storm
And I will lift my hands
That you are who you are
No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm

And though my heart is torn
I will praise you in this storm
When the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

I was a hollow man
My treachery despised and rightly so
And even though my chains were gone
I'm still a slave and reaping what I've sown
Call it desperation, I just had to see His face
So like a child, I climbed a sycamore tree
When the God-man called my name
I knew I'd never be the same

'Cause when the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

I was a runaway, a gypsy chasing shadows in the night
A prisoner of secrets till religion dragged my shame into the light
All my darkness was revealed, just when I thought my fate was sealed
My accusers dropped their stones and walked away
'Cause when the God-man cleansed my name
I knew I'd never be the same

'Cause when the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

You can come just as you are
Let Him have your broken heart
You have never run too far
There is freedom in His scars

You can come just as you are
Let Him have your broken heart
You have never run too far
There is freedom in His scars

'Cause when the God-man passes by
The blind will see and the dead will rise
Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight
When the God-man passes by

When the God-man passes by
We were made to be courageous
We were made to lead the way
We could be the generation
That finally breaks the chains
We were made to be courageous
We were made to be courageous

We were warriors on the front lines
Standing, unafraid
But now we're watchers on the sidelines
While our families slip away

Where are you, men of courage?
You were made for so much more
Let the pounding of our hearts cry
We will serve the Lord

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees with lifted hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

This is our resolution
Our answer to the call
We will love our wives and children
We refuse to let them fall

We will reignite the passion
That we buried deep inside
May the watchers become warriors
Let the men of God arise

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees with lifted hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

Seek justice
Love mercy
Walk humbly with your God

In the war of the mind
I will make my stand
In the battle of the heart
And the battle of the hand

In the war of the mind
I will make my stand
In the battle of the heart
And the battle of the hand

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees with lifted hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

We were made to be courageous
Lord, make us courageous
When I'm standing at the end of me
In the rubble of my broken dreams
And the wells I've dug aren't filling me
And the world I've made's not what it seems to be
My life, Your grace
Here I exchange

All of me for all You are
I lay at Your feet my broken heart
And I'll find my healing in Your scars
All of me for all You are

You're the anchor in a raging sea
In the center of the storm You are my peace
You're the dreamer of my destiny
And all You have begun You will complete

Your life, my gain
Here I exchange

All of me for all You are
I lay at Your feet my broken heart
And I'll find my healing in Your scars
All of me for all You are

All of me, I lay down for all You are
All of me, I lay down for all You are
Jesus, all of me, I lay down for all You are
All of me, I lay down for all You are

All of me for all You are
I lay at Your feet my broken heart
And I'll find my healing in Your scars
All of me for all You are

My life, Your grace
Here I exchange
Your life, my gain
Here I exchange

All of me, I lay down for all You are
All of me, I lay down for all You are
Jesus, all of me, I lay down for all You are
All of me, I lay down for all You are

And I'll find my healing in Your scars
All of me for all You are
