Lyrics
I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see

All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see

All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
I'm Looking at you for a minute 900 people die
I'm Looking Away because! I did And you can't
Why? Because I'm looking back

I'm citizen insane
I'm citizen insane
I'm a citizen now
Look out! Danger is coming in

How could I. It is cold what is
Near? Look out Danger through me
In the pool no-one in but me
I'm citizen insane
I'm citizen insane

I'm a citizen now [Repeat: x 4]

Worry!
How'd you
Get your
Teeth so
Pearly?
Dew-drop
Dentures
Whitewashed
Faces
She runs from
The third world, pearly
Vanilla (feel it crawl to me)
Milkshakes (crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (whatever you say)
Cafes (it won't go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me)
She got her (crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (it won't go away)
For white boys (whatever you say)

She runs from
The third world, pearly
Hurts me
Darling hurts me
Darling hurts me
Darling hurts me
I never wanted anything like this 
I worked hard, tried hard 
I ran around in domestic bliss 
I fought hard, died long 
Every time you're running out of here 
Every time you're running I get the fear 

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home 
Your words surround me and asphyxiate 
And I burn all hate 

Every time you're running out on me 
Every time you're running I can see 

[Chorus]
I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself 

The waters spray, the waters run all over me 
The waters spray, the waters run 
And this time you gonna pay 

[Chorus]
I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion
I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion

And as the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it any more
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door

I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear
In my mind 
And nailed into my heels 
All the time killin' what I feel 
And everything I touch turns into stone 
All wrapped up in crinoline 
All wrapped up in sugar-coated 

Just in case I blow out 

I am glued 

Just in case I crack out 
And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch turns to stone 

All wrapped up in crinoline 
All wrapped up in sugar-coated
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easily
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird lights float into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
I was born for your magazines
For your magazines
I am trapped in the society page
Of your magazines
Of your magazines
I don't know what it means

Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?
(These are things that get on my nerves)
Do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?
At the end of the tunnel?
(You better start naming names)
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

Gather up the pitiful (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

What seems impossible (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)

I think I have had my fill (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

I think I should give up the ghost (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

A glass, a gun, a bullet for us will make
Everybody wants to be a ?
Killer cars
Cars
Killer cars

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get out of the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive

Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive
Killer cars

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
No, they won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive
Killer cars

They all drive
Killer cars
They all drive
Killer cars

Oh, killer cars
Oh, killer
Killer
Killer cars
Cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Ah, killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
That there 
That's not me 
I go 
Where I please 
I walk through walls 
I float down the Liffey 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 

In a little while 
I'll be gone 
The moment's already passed 
Yeah it's gone 
And I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here
How'd you
Get your
Teeth so
Pearly?
Dew-drop
Dentures
Whitewashed
Faces
She runs from
The third world, pearly
Vanilla (feel it crawl to me)
Milkshakes (crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (whatever you say)
Cafes (it won't go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me)
She got her (crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (it won't go away)
For white boys (whatever you say)

She runs from
The third world, pearly
Hurts me
Darling hurts me
Darling hurts me
Darling hurts me
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easily
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from
Moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice 
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

And my mother say we don't't love you son some more
And the buildings say let me spit on your face some more
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong 
'Cause I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Dear sir, I have a complaint 
Can't remember what it is 
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway

Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering, start shouting
You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension 
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull

There's nothing more dull
Than talkin', talkin' 'bout yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
I want to, I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds, the birds

You want me, well fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting with a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

You want me, well, come on and break the door down
You want me, fucking come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my mouth
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Cut him up
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my mouth
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cut him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
His blood is frozen
Still there is no point letting it go to waste

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection

It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change

Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edge
It barks at no one else
But me
Like it's seen
A ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks
A-flowin'
No one else
Would know

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you
See sparks
They ask me where the hell
I'm going?
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down
Wake
From your sleep
The drying of
Your tears
Today
We escape
We escape

Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before
All hell
Breaks loose
Breathe
Keep breathing
Don't loose
Your nerve
Breathe
Keep breathing
I can't do this
Alone

Sing
Us a song
A song to keep
Us warm
There's
Such a chill
Such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your
Rules and wisdom choke you

Now
We are one
In everlasting peace

We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope
That you choke
That you choke
Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can?
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh

I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionettes
Floating around on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth

Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
there are things to talk about * deconstructive * but we bet * we can use * we can slaughter with the gloom * how many times * no one moves * we're your trap * no one moves * and won't you quiet down * and don't you cry now * and won't you quiet down * and don't you cry now * and don't you crack down * quiet down * oh no they're in your way * come on i know the right things to say * oh yeah everytime democracy pays * so we're on the streets now * its all over the streets * we're out of here * its all over the streets at night * its all over the streets at night * get me out of here * all over * its all over the streets * we're out of here * we are the dollar and cents and the pound and pence and the mark and the yen * we're gonna gonna crack your little soul * we are the dollar and cents and the pound and pence and the mark and the yen * we're gonna crack your little soul * we are the dollar and cents and the pound and pence
While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

And this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land
And this just feels like spinning plates
My body is floating down the muddy river
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends

He said,
I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice

But now
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating
Like with myxomatosis

But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and salivate
Like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you
Should put me down

I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart arse
But we all like stars
That wasn't my intention
I did it for a reason

It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis 
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe around, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe around, tie them down

May pretty horses
Come to you
As you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
We're bad things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues

Even when it's only warnings
Even when you talk the war games

Oh Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)

You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We won our goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe

All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
There'll be something missing
And now that you found it
It's gone
Now you feel it you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
You never wash up after yourself
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground

I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up

Little babies eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)

Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)

Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)

Anytime (sit down)
Anytime
Stand up (the rain drops the rain drops)
Sit down (the rain drops the rain drops)
Oh

[Repeat: x46]
The rain drops
I wrapped you inside my coat
When they came to fire upon the house
I didn't feel pain
Cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your smile

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn your world into doubt
Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
Oh
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before
Before
Before

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn your world into doubt
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn you world into doubt
Yeah
I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet
Was shot
If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this

Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me

And if I sat down
And crossed my arms 
Hold me to
This song

Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take a chair
And start to talk shit

If I get old
Remind me of this
The night we kissed
And I really meant it

Whatever happens
If we're still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song
I am gone
Everybody's waiting
And these fruit
Just a twist of poison
I won't be alone
When you're running in me
I can't stay
Like I'm somewhere always
I need more
A restless body cracks and rolls
I won't have the strength
When you're running in me
He's bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants 
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong 
He wants you to listen, he wants us to weep 
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you? 
How do you? 

He lives with his mother, but we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy, 'cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies, any way that he can 

How do you, how do you, how do you?
Wake from your sleep
Breathe, keep breathing

You can laugh a spineless laugh

We hope that you choke
In pitch dark 
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches 
Trip me as I speak 

Just 'cause you feel it 
Doesn't mean it's there 
Just 'cause you feel it 
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck 
(Don't reach out, don't reach out 
Don't reach out, don't reach out) 
Steer away from each rocks 
We'd be a walking disaster 
(Don't reach out, don't reach out 
Don't reach out, don't reach out) 

Just 'cause you feel it 
Doesn't mean it's there 
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder) 
Just 'cause you feel it 
Doesn't mean it's there 
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder) 
There there! 

Why so green and lonely? 
Lonely, lonely? 

Heaven sent you to me 
To me, to me? 

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen 

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh

Make a sound
Move back home
Pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh

Has the light gone out for you?
'Cause the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
And they brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All the lies run around my face
All the lies run around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see

I'm alive

I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
Oh Maria, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently

I didn't care but now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out

That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
Once again I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

Once again packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highness's

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only
There's someone listening in
You are the sun the moon and stars 
Ah you... and I could never run away from you 
You try at working out chaotic things 
And why should I believe myself? 

It's like the world is gonna end so soon 
And why should I believe myself? 

Yeah... 

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire 
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys 
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed 
You feel it till you're dry 
You feel it till you've had enough 
And you don't understand 
No ripcord, no ripcord 
No ripcord, no ripcord
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean 
Oh it's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane 

A thousand miles an hour 
On politics and power 
That you don't understand 

No ripcord, no ripcord 
No, no, no ripcord, no ripcord 

La la la la 

The answer to your prayers 
We'll drop you anywhere 

No ripcord, no ripcord 
No ripcord, no, no, no ripcord yeah
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Who's in a bunker?
Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first
And the children

I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst
Until I

Who's in a bunker?
Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much
I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen it

I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first
And children

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Ice age coming
Ice age coming
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both

Ice age coming
Ice age coming

We're not scaremongering
This is really happening
Happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening

Mobiles squerking
Mobiles chirping
Take the money run
Take the money run
Take the money

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Everything all of the time

Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

The first of the children [Repeat until fade]
When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green

You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you after it's too late
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
And the wise man said "I don't want to hear your voice" 
And the thin man said "I don't want to hear your voice" 
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

And my mother say "We don't love you son some more" 
And the buildings say "Let me spit on your face some more" 
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong
Cause I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

Dear Sir, "I have a complaint 
"Can't remember what it is 
"That's why I'm here" 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop

Kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love

They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the once who'll spit at you
You'll be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had is gone away

D-don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions

Easy tumble, easy doll
Easy rumble, easy fall
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions
Loose ropes still tied knots
I can't believe that I returned
Loose threads still they sew
It's just I can't believe that we returned
Let's get out
Out
Will you come out with me?
It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling

Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmers or spells
Your shimmers or spells

We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

(One day at a time)
One day at a time

We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

One day at a time
You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
You are so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected, eager to please
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home

Saying, everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss, you can break all the rules

But still, everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

This far but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweet
So full of sleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

Ah ah ah
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our,
You fell into a

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
You got some nerve
Comin' here comin' here
You got some nerve
Comin' here comin' here

You stole it all
Give it back
Give it back
Give it back
 
You know you should
But you don't but you don't
You know you should
But you don't but you don't
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Go

Tears of joy now scare ourselves of all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
'Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel, I will always be- 

Right, one, two, three, four

So sell your suit and tie and come and live with me
Leukemia, schizophrenia, polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean
Oh
If you don't believe this, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

Oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
Obtain

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great job, no message coming in
And you're so small
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

The path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
And the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care

I feel this often, go
I feel this often, go
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground

I won't let this happen
To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell

With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up

Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

Little baby's eyes
Eyes
Eyes
I was
Stronger
I was
Better
Picked you out
Now don't
Say a word

No don't
Yell out
Never mind
Let you out
Led you back

Stay on
Sit down

Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would've drowned you at birth

Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I walk down the staircase, 
Magnetic pull.
Back to the other place
That I cannot go.
I'm sending a chopper, 
To steal you away.

The pot is full, 
Let me take control, 
Let me take control.

The pot is full
Of secrets to be told, 
Secrets to be told.

Out of orbit
And I always will.

The pot is full, 
Let me take control, 
Let me take control.

The pot is full
Of secrets to be told, 
Secrets to be told
Who's in a bunker, who's in a bunker?
Women and children first and the children first and the children

I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst until I

Who's in a bunker who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen it

I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first and the children first and the children

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Ice age coming ice age coming
Let me hear both sides let me hear both sides let me hear both

Ice age coming ice age coming
Throw it in the fire throw it in the fire throw it on the

We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
Mobiles squearking mobiles chirping
Take the money run take the money run take the money

Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)

Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt

You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Please forget the words that I just blurted out 
It wasn't me, it was a strange and creeping doubt 
It keeps rattling my cage 
There's nothing in this world will keep it down 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't 

So many things that keep, keep me underground 
So many words that I, that I can never find 

If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

Even though I might, even though I try

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near

Everyone

Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Fitter, happier
More productive
Comfortable
Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely
And they pray

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon, expending
And all you have to do is say yeah

All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down too deep lonely
And they pray
Honey, come to me before it's too late

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon, expelling
And all you have to do is say yeah
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why

I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(And jellyfish float by)
And jellyfish float by

(It's what keeps me alive)
You don't wanna talk to me,
You don't wanna say the words,
You try to get off the hook,
You try to get off the hook.
Sprawling on a pin,
Hanging off the hook,
Trying to get yourself away,
Trying to get yourself away.

There's no use dwelling on,
On what might have been,
Just think of all the fun,
You could be having.

We know the way you talk,
We know what you want,
We know what you want,
What you really wanted.

Take a look around,
There's candles on the cake,
On what might have been,
The road you should have took,
Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on,
No use dwelling on.

It's such a beautiful day,
It's such a beautiful day,
Find yourself a ?
Go and get some rest.

It's such a beautiful day.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go up to the mic,
Go up to the mic,
Go and get some rest.
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?

Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe around, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe around, tie them down

May pretty horses
Come to you
As you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back

Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my memories

(Oh)
(No no no no no no)

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my melody
(We're on. That's a nice way to start Johnny)

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes a five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because,
You have not been!

Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been paying attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been paying attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been paying attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention oohh

I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
Cozimnot
Cozimnot

I swat 'em like flies but like flies the buggers keep coming back not!
But I'm not

All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief

But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the box
Cozimnot
Cozimnot

Oh go and tell the king that the sky is falling in

When it's not
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could've sworn I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Lets go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you

Open up, let me in
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

Never look back
Never look back
There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors on the rudders of big ships
We are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors
And there are secret doors
There are doors that lock
And doors that don't

There are doors that let you in
And out
But never open
But they are trapdoors
That you can't come back from
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why

I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(And jellyfish float by)
And jellyfish float by

(It's what keeps me alive)
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life
Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm

If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionettes
Floating around on a prison ship

If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you can try the best you can
If you try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion
I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion

And as the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it any more
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door

I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear
One two three four

Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like domino's
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
Take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to
What you ought to
An elephant thats in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
In duplicate and duplicate
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
A last stop
There's no real reason
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin

And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down

I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life

In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too

Every one one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy, been kidding myself for so long

I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay too
It's like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture

And my heart, in my mouth
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just your number
I want stay on it
And get back under

And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong

(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

When at last you'll give in
When at last you'll give in

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please

I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
I can't afford to breathe in this town 
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand 
Look back up to the cathode ray 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself 

I want to breathe, I want to grow 
I'd say I want it but I don't know how 
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray 

And I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself 

I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself (whoa)
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
The moon is high up on a mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, "We're here to keep your prices down
We'll feed you to the hounds
To the daily mail, to get up, together"

You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
Paid off security and got through the gate
You got away with it but we lie in wait, eh
Eh, eh

Where's the truth what's the use
I'm hanging around lost and found
And when you're here innocent
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life

You'll keep time, you've no right
You're fast to lose, you will lose
You jumped the queue, you're back again
President for life, love of all
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
The fish in the sea have lost command
In my mind and nailed into my heels
All the time killing what I feel

And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
Turns to stone

And everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
Turns stone

I am fused just in case I blow out
I am glued just because I crack out

Everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
[All wrapped up in cotton wool]
[All wrapped up and sugar coated]
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change

Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edge
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trap doors that open
I spiral down
You're living in a fantasy
You're living in a fantasy
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
You're living in a fantasy
You're living in a fantasy
You're living in a fantasy
In this beautiful world

???
Wake
From your sleep
The drying of
Your tears
Today
We escape
We escape

Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before
All hell
Breaks loose
Breathe
Keep breathing
Don't loose
Your nerve
Breathe
Keep breathing
I can't do this
Alone

Sing
Us a song
A song to keep
Us warm
There's
Such a chill
Such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your
Rules and wisdom choke you

Now
We are one
In everlasting peace

We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope
That you choke
That you choke
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air

I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement

Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home

Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets

They're all
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight

Oh

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be alright
Alright
I'm alright
Alright

I'm just
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
And screwed me in a vice

And now I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied"

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

"I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied

Don't know why
I feel so skinned alive."

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

"now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars"
That wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

"I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied"
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop

Kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love

They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the once who'll spit at you
You'll be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had is gone away

D-don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime
Stand up (the rain drops the rain drops)
Sit down (the rain drops the rain drops)
Oh
The rain drops x47
I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt

I jumped into the river

There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
I'm walking out
In a force ten gale
Birds thrown around
Bullets for hail

The roof is pulling off
By its fingernails
Your voice is rapping
On my window sill

Yesterday's headlines
Blown by the wind
Yesterday's people
End up

Scatterbrain
Then any fool can
Easy pick a hole
('I only with I could fall in')

A moving target
In a firing range
Somewhere I'm not

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lighting fuse

Nothing touches me, man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldn't take one of them
Little drills to get through it

I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went

Nothing touches me
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me, man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So I've given up looking out of it

I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away she's split
She went

Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now

Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now

There are many things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues

Even when it's only warnings
Even when you talk the war games

Oh why don't you quiet down? (maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down? (maybe I want to live in the children's land and you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down? (maybe I'll wander the promised land I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down? (I want to live in the promised land and maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down (yeah, and there, there we can free)

You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We won our goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe

All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence (quiet down)
And the mark and the yen, and yeah 
We're gonna crack your little souls (why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls (why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence (why don't you quiet down?)
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
We're gonna crack your little souls

We are the dollars and cents
I've had these jeans since i was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mom and dad will not give in

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared too talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
After years of waiting
Nothing came
And as your life flashed before your eyes you realize
I'm a reasonable man, get off, get off, get off my case

Get off my case

Don't fall asleep at the wheel
I waited for you but you never came
Please keep moving

And the wise man said "I don't want to hear your voice" 
And the thin man said "I don't want to hear your voice" 
And they're cursing me 
And they won't let me be 
There's nothing to say 
And there's nothing to do 
Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

And my mother say "We don't't love you son some more" 
And the buildings say "Let me spit on your face some more" 
And the feeling is 
That there's something wrong 
'cause I can't find the words 
And I can't find the song 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting 

Dear Sir, "I have a complaint 
"Can't remember what it is 
"That's why I'm here" 

Stop whispering, start shouting 
Stop whispering, start shouting
Here it comes, Here it comes,
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.
Oh baby burn

Fast die younger
Burns rubber
Useless rockers
From England
Good times
Had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your crutches
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
Interstate fire walk staright down the middle,
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby burn
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking
This slow

My baby's got the bends
Oh, no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?

They brought in the C.I.A
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky-high

Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would-

I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
When I need you
I've had these jeans since i was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mom and dad will not give in

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared too talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And i can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Bummed out again
Buy early business friend
The smell of fear is bigger than you think

Hey don't do it
Do it

Change seem to fit
In the end you just feel sick
And then you choke on an anesthetic

Hey don't do it
Lewis
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really matters here

We never noticed
We never understood
He just get crushed to fit
He never even smile

At the best, it's the best,
It's the best day I know

Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really matters here

Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground

To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell

With white elephants
Sitting ducks

Rise up

Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

Little baby's eyes
Eyes

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knives you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers city
Boys in first class don't know we're born just know
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over
Get up get over and turn the tape off

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

So I'm just gonna
It's like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture

And my heart, in my mouth
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just your number
I want stay on it
And get back under

And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong

(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Like I'm fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

When at last you'll give in
When at last you'll give in

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
I'm walking out in a force-ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my window-sill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people in a scatterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole
I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
And I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't belong here.
Destiny... destiny protect me from the world
Destiny... hold my hand, protect me from the world 
Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 

And if the world does turn 
And if London burns 
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar 
I want to be in a band 
When I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't 
be a nothing anymore 

Grow my hair... grow my hair I am Jim Morrison 
Grow my hair... I want to be want to be want to be Jim Morrison 

Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 

As the world does turn

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there
It wasn't like that

You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned

In a drunken punch-up at a wedding
Yeah
Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison

A bull in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay
Frozen to the spot
The pointless snide remarks

Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding yeah
Oh no, no, no
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof

Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bullet proof

So pay the money and take a shot
Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof

And bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
Kid A, kid A
Kid A, kid A

Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Mother Mary come for me
For I am a wicked child
I have sinned and I am so confused
For I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

I am the Devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk the crooked mile
Yeah I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

If I could have kept on the straight and narrow
If I could have kept on the straight and narrow
But God broke your heart
God broke your heart

Now I wake up in the night
He's tugging at my arms and legs
Like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus
To radiate his lie
To radiate his lie
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all 

When I see you messing me around
I dont want to know, I dont want to know, I dont want to
Did I see you messing me around?
I dont want to know, I dont want to know, I dont want to know

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

Broken hearts make it rain

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we cant create, that we cant create, that we cant
Pieces of a wreck of mankind
That we cant create, that we cant create

When all I see you messing me around
I dont want to know, I dont want to know, I dont want 
When I see you searching me around
I dont want to know, I dont want to know, I dont want to know
Blow into this paperbag,
Go home, stop grinning at everyone.
Blow into this paperbag,
Go home, stop grinning at everyone.

It was nice when it lasted,
But now it's gone.
It was nice when it lasted,
But now it's gone.

Blow into this paperbag.

Take your armor off,
You're not under attack.
Take your armor off,
You're not under attack.

Come on, come on.
Blow into this paperbag,
Go home, stop grinning at everyone.
Blow into this paperbag,
Go home, stop grinning at everyone.

And they were honeybees
On a blade of grass.
Take your armor off,
You're not under attack.

Blow into this paperbag.
Blow into this paperbag.
Beauty will destroy your mind
Spare the gory details
Give them gift wrap for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life
I was confused
I'm butcher
Feel nothing
As it closes up my arms
The position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart
Into my brain

I'm the big slack basic combination
Cut out
Chop, liver on the block
My heart still pumping
My heart still pumping

He's a warrior, warrior
He's a little bitch coming out of him
He's a warrior, warrior
He's a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him

Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you

Funny how, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing

With your breathing
They will suck you down to the other side x4
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
They should be ringing x12
This is the gloaming
Shadows blue and red

If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this

Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me

And if I sat down
And crossed my arms 
Hold me to
This song

Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take a chair
And start to talk shit

If I get old
Remind me of this
The night we kissed
And I really meant it

Whatever happens
If we're still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song
Oh, Banana Co.
We really love you, and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co.
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth

That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
Wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love

But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
Are you such a dreamer?
To put the world to rights?
Ill stay home forever
Where two & two always
makes up five

Ill lay down the tracks
Sandbag & hide
January has Aprils showers
And two & two always
makes up five

Its the devils way now
There is no way out
You can scream & you
can shout
It is too late now
Because

You have not been
paying attention

I try to sing along
I get it all wrong
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee
NOT
I swat em like flies but
Like flies the burgers
Keep coming back
NOT
Maybe not
"All hail to the thief"
"But I am not!"
"Dont question my authority
or put me in the dock"
Cozimnot!
Go & tell the king that
The sky is falling in
When its not
Maybe not.
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And 2 and 2 always makes a 5

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because you have not been payin' attention
Payin' attention, payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been payin' attention
Payin' attention, payin' attention
Payin' attention

You have not been payin' attention
Payin' attention, payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been payin' attention
Payin' attention, payin' attention
Payin' attention

I try to sing along but the music's all wrong
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies the bugs keep coming back
But I'm not

All hail to the thief, all hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
Oh go and tell the king that the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not
But it's not, maybe not
Maybe not!

Rust in the mountains
Rust in the brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim
Up on the roof tops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak
He's talking out the world
Talking out the world 
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway

I wanted you so bad 
And I couldn't say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad 
We couldn't say
These things fall apart
We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Truant kids a can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from
Their chestnut tree
Long white gloves
Police tread carefully
Escaped from the zoo
The perfect child facsimile
It's talking out the world
Talking out the world
There's a little child runnin' 'round this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done now
How did you go bad?

Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

Morning bell 
Morning bell 
Release me 
Release me 
You can keep the furniture 
Bump on the head 
Haul 'em down the chimney
Release me 
Release me 
Please
Release me 
Release me 
Where'd you park the car 
Where'd you park the car 
Clothes are all always on the furniture 
Now I might as well 
I might as well 
Sleezy jack 
The fire drill 
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round
Cut the kids in half 
Cut the kids in half 
Cut the kids in half
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache

With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday..

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me..

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad check
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me

I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.
I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapse on us

Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no-one drives

So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
Worry Wort Lyrics
You don't wanna talk to me
You don't wanna say the word
You're tryin' to get off the hook
You're tryin' to get off the hook

Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
You're trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away
There's no use dwelling on

On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want

What you really wanted
Take a look around
There's candles on the cake
On what might have been
Roads you should have took

Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on
Its such a beautiful day
Its such a beautiful day

Find yourself another end
Go on and get some rest
Its such a beautiful day
Its such a beautiful day

Go up to the mic
Go up to the mic
Go and get some rest.
Oh no, pop is dead
Long live pop.
It died an ugly death,
By back catalogue.

And know you know it gets you nowhere,
And now you know you realize.

Oh no, pop is dead
It just gave up,
We raise the dead but they won't stand up.

And radio have salmonella,
And now you know you gotta die.
It left this message for us.

So what, pop is dead, it's no great loss
So many face lifts, it's face flew off.

The Emperor he has no clothes on,
And his skin is pealing off.

Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop,
One final lot of coke to jack him off...
Jack him off.. He left this message for us.

He left this message for us.
He left this message for us.
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin

And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down

I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will now mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling into the sea
Into the sea

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive

And there's be no more lies
There's be no more lies
There's be no more lies
There's be no more lies

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Reckoner
Take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings
That there 
That's not me 
I go 
Where I please 
I walk through walls 
I float down the Liffey 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 

In a little while 
I'll be gone 
The moment's already passed 
Yeah it's gone 
And I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here 

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes 
I'm not here 
This isn't happening 
I'm not here 
I'm not here
Go

Tears of joy now scare ourselves of all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
'Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel, I will always be- 

Right, one, two, three, four

So sell your suit and tie and come and live with me
Leukemia, schizophrenia, polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean
Oh
If you don't believe this, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

Oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
Obtain
Obtain
Are you such a dreamer,
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever,
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks,
Sandbag and hide,
January has April showers,
And two and two always makes a five

It's the Devil's way now,
There is no way out,
You can scream and you can shout,
It is too late now

Because you have not been
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

Yeah I feel it, I needed attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

Yeah I need it, I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention

Yeah I love it, the attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

(Soon, oh)
I try to sing along,
I get it all wrong,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies,
But like flies the buggers keep coming back

But I'm not,
Oh hail to the thief,
Oh hail to the thief

But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the dock,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not

Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in,
But it's not,
But it's not
But it's not

Maybe not,
Maybe not
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
Voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your parked car
I am holidays
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves

It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
Were rotten fruit
Were damaged goods
What the hell
We got nothing more
To lose
One gust & we
Will probably crumble
Were back drifters.

This far but no further
Im hanging off a branch
Im teetering on the brink
Oh honeysweet
So full of sleep
Im backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried
But there was nothing
We could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So youre backtracking

Ah ah ah
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our, ah
You fell into a

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're back drifters
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders and wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah-ah
Please could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?

When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
Come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
From a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
God loves his childrean
God loves his children, yeah
I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I
Don't have a choice
Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car
Or in my hair

I think I've been here before
Yes I've been here before
The last time you locked
All the doors

And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I
Don't have a choice

And yes I am
Yes I am

I think I've told you once
I think I needed advice
You were such a help
That's very nice

I think I've been here before
Yes I've been here before
But this time I kick
Down your door

Yes I am
Yes I am
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down
Let down
Let down

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling
Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?

Down is the new up
Is the new up

Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?

Your services
Are not required
Your future's bleak
You're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen
Without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate
I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?

Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up

You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us

All on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

Shake your pockets out
Pass it on
Pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I've been where I like"
"I've slept with who I liked"
"She ate me up for breakfast"
"She screwed me in a vice"

"But now
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied"

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and a-salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.

Like my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

Yeah no one likes a smartarse but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention (tension), I did it for a reason (treason)
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
What do you want from me?
Now you got me
Now my fingers bleed
Now they're staring at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace

Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

What do you want from me?
Now you got me
Now my energy you suck from me
And I'm holding on for dear life

Quit smothering me
Quit laughing at me
I've got a disease
An English disease
It won't let go
It won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

What did you put in that syringe?
Whatever you really said to him?
Is sitting there, inside of me

And you bother me
You possess me
You're there again
Ahead of me
And I won't let go
I won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour

Murderers you're murderers
We are not the same as you

Genie let out the bottle
Funny ha ha funny how

When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing

When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side

To the shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells

They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing

This is the gloaming
They love me like I was their brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with
Her answer-phone
She says she'd love to come help but
The sea would
Electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough

Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
In my mind 
And nailed into my heels 
All the time killin' what I feel 
And everything I touch (all wrapped up in cotton wool) 
(All wrapped up and sugar coated) turns into stone 
And everything I touch (all wrapped up in cotton wool) 
(All wrapped up and sugar coated) turns into stone 

I am fused just in case I blow out
I am glued just because I crack out

Everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in crinoline, all wrapped up in sugar-coated) turn to stone
I'm walkin' out
In a force ten gale.
Birds thrown around
Bullets for hail.
The roof is pullin' off by its fingernails.
Your voice is rapping on my window sill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind.
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain.
Any fool can easy pick a hole. (I only wish I could fall in)

A moving target in a firin' range.

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Lightning fuse
Powercut.
Scatterbrain.

Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light

The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
In my spirit white
Totally alive
In my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didnt know
Totally alive
Totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

Standing on the edge of you
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
You are the sun the moon and stars
Are you and I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you

It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

Yeah

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire 

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything

In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Everything
Everything
Everything

In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place
There are two colors in my head
There are two colors in my head
What is that you tried to say
What is that you tried to say

Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say

Everything
Everything
Everything
You are the sun the moon and stars 
Ah you... and I could never run away from you 
You try at working out chaotic things 
And why should I believe myself? 

It's like the world is gonna end so soon 
And why should I believe myself? 

Yeah... 

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire 
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
It's funny how
To drive your stupid car
It's funny how
'Cause I never get that far

And you put my brain in overload
And i can't change gears
I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes
And I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
Moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark

And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Turn to nasty now
The dark cell
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt
You've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get earnest
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look

Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal

Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look

Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders and wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah-ah
This dance
This dance
It's like a weapon
It's like a weapon
Of self defense
Self defense
Against the present
Against the present
Present tense

I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'm dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost

I won't turn around when the penny drops
I won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain

Stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
That all this love
Has been in vain

In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends

He said I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice

But now
I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied
I sat in the cupboard

And wrote it down real neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis

But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in devon


I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down

I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

Yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
But that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up

I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me, now I want more

Standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
Its all been sent to recover hell
The bangers and the mash
The negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not

Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police or vice-chancellor
Lord and lady, blah blah
The vicar or the judge
You are dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison, and I want more

If you are on top
Then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power
We're changing the hour
If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark
The black will stare back
Back into your soul

The cheque came through
The cheque came through
The cheque, cheque, cheque

The cheque came through
The cheque came through
The cheque, cheque, cheque
The cheque came through

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
When I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
I'm kicking at the wall

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
Poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
I got the poison
I will stop
I will stop at nothing
Say the right things
When electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards, you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards, you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Ha, ha, ha

Riot shields
Voodoo economics
It's life, it's life
It's just business
Cattle prods and the I.M.F.
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards, you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards, you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?

Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood

Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten? Moth eaten?

We suck young blood
We suck young blood

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood
Please forget the words that I just blurted out 
It wasn't me, it was a strange and creeping doubt 
It keeps rattling my cage 
There's nothing in this world will keep it down 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't 

So many things that keep, keep me underground 
So many words that I, that I can never find 

If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't

Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say

Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off

Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, pouring down the street

Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

Move along
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there
And it wasn't like that
You came here
Just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch up at a wedding
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop

When I turn around you stay
Frozen to the spot
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammer headed sharks
The pot will call the kettle black

It's a drunken punchup at a wedding, yeah
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
Weird fishes
Get towed by the worms
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all
Give it back
You stole it all
Give it back

Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
I turn my back, walk away

You know you should
But you don't
You know you should
But you don't

Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
Are you such a dreamer,
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever,
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks,
Sandbag and hide,
January has April showers,
And two and two always makes a five

It's the Devil's way now,
There is no way out,
You can scream and you can shout,
It is too late now

Because you have not been
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

Yeah I feel it, I needed attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

Yeah I need it, I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention

Yeah I love it, the attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention

(Soon, oh)
I try to sing along,
I get it all wrong,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies,
But like flies the buggers keep coming back

But I'm not,
Oh hail to the thief,
Oh hail to the thief

But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the dock,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not

Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in,
But it's not,
But it's not
But it's not

Maybe not,
Maybe not
Once again I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

Once again packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only....
There's someone listening in
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As the magic disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again

The walls abandon shape
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the noise
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you start unraveling
Before you take my mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaws falling into place
There is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaws falling into place
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could've sworn I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Lets go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you

Open up, let me in
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

Never look back
Never look back
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten? Moth eaten?

We suck young blood 
We suck young blood
Won't let that creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned
We want the sweet meats
We want young blood
Been thinking about you, your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?

All the things you got,
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes,
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
Why should you care when I'm not there?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
When I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when I'm not there?

All the things you got
That you'll never need
All the things you got
I'm played out and bleed to please you

Been thinking about you
We're bad things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues

Even when it's only warnings
Even when you talk the war games

Oh Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)

You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We won our goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe

All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday..

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me..

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me

I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.
Don't
Forget
That you are our son
Now
Go back to bed

We just know
That you are ours
You won't cry
Too hard

Death
To all
Who stand in your way
My arm, you
Killer cars ... cars
Killer cars

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get outta the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?

I'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping that steel

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say

I'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
What if that car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

Killer cars ...

Wrap me up in the back of a trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive, cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive ... killer cars
They all drive ... killer cars
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace 
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living, 
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands 
Your crazy-kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives 
On lollipops and crisps

Just don't leave
Don't leave

Just don't leave
Don't leave
I can't afford to breathe in this town 
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand 
Look back up to the cathode ray 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself 

I want to breathe, I want to grow 
I'd say I want it but I don't know how 
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray 

And I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself

Oh, Banana Co.
We really love you, and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co.
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah

I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray 

I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off... 

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself 

I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off... 

Prove yourself..
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?

This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)

All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
Oh
You really me
Really mess
Ah
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace 
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave
Don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives 
On lollipops and crisps

Just don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave
I never wanted anything like this 
I worked hard, tried hard 
I ran around in domestic bliss 
I fought hard, died long 
Every time you're running out of here 
Every time you're running I get the fear 

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home 
Your words surround me and asphyxiate 
And I burn all hate 

Every time you're running out on me 
Every time you're running I can see 

I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself 

The waters spray, the waters run all over me 
The waters spray, the waters run 
And this time you gonna pay 

I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself
Oh, Banana Co.
We really love you, and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to, she's seen you
And oh, Banana Co.
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah
I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mom and dad will not give in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared too talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt

You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
No [Repeat: x 42]

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you.
(By the way) I was there and
It wasn't like that.

You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned

In a drunken punch-up at a wedding
Yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison

A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay
Frozen to the spot
You had the pointless snide remarks

Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding yeah
Oh no no
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird lights float into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
There there

Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely?

Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me?

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
Moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark

And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen from my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are loosing it, can't you tell?

We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Iron lung

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out we'll just hum

This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung

If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay 

If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

Gather up the pitiful (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

What seems impossible (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)

I think I have had my fill (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)

I think I should give up the ghost (don't hurt me)

In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
Destiny, destiny protect me from the world.
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
And I don't see no confusion anywhere.

And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.

Grow my hair, grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison,
Grow my hair, I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison.
Here we are with our running and confusion,
And I don't see no confusion anywhere.

And if the world does turn and if London burns,
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar.
I want to be in a band when I get to heaven,
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing any more.
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging around for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, whoa

Say, hey

You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
Do it to yourself
Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond, beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return

And it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you

The white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through

We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up

This is a low flying panic attack
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers

This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?

Down is the new up
Is the new up

Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?

Your services
Are not required
Your future's bleak
You're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen
Without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate
I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?

Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up

You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us

All on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

Shake your pockets out
Pass it on
Pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof

Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bullet proof

So pay the money and take a shot
Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof

And bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
You there
Get up on that wall
Get up on that
Who? Who? you (fool) you, you (fool) you, you
Toodaloo

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rappin' upon my windowsill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up sktterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole
I only wish I could fall in

A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Somewhere I'm not sktterbrain
Lightning fuse, power cut, sktterbrain

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because you're not there
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

Yeah I feel it, I needed attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

Yeah I need it, I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention

Yeah I love it, the attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Soon oh

I try to sing along
But the music's all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not

I'll swallow up flies?
Back and hide
But I'm not

Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the box
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not

Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home

Saying, everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss, you can break all the rules

But still, everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell
(Sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell
(Stand up)

Anytime
(Sit down)
Anytime
(Stand up)
Sit down, stand up
Sit down

We can wipe you out anytime
(Stand up)
We can wipe you out
(Sit down)

Anytime
Anytime
Stand up
Sit down

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache

With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
And in your life, there comes the darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people
We are helpless to resist
In your darkest hour

But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
Split infinite

And in your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
In your darkest hour

If you had another one
If you had another name
So dark

We will never, never know
We will never, never know
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
Turn to nasty now
The dark cell
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt
You've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get earnest
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look

Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal

Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look

Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection

It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
I'm walkin' out
In a force ten gale.
Birds thrown around
Bullets for hail.
The roof is pullin' off by its fingernails.
Your voice is rapping on my window sill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind.
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain.
Any fool can easy pick a hole. (I only wish I could fall in)

A moving target in a firin' range.

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain.
Lightning fuse
Powercut.
Scatterbrain.
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think
Start again begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never go back
Never go back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Come back
Come back
Ah, ah
Ah
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
I was
Stronger
I was
Better
Picked you out
Now don't
Say a word

No don't
Yell out
Never mind
Let you out
Led you back

Stay on
Sit down

Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground

Just like everybody
Stepping over hills
Running from the underground

This is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide

This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is our warning
4 minute warning
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knives you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers city
Boys in First Class don't know we're born just know
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over
Get up get over and turn the tape off

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

So I'm just gonna
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera
Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a shear drop

How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
Super collider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Parting from the soup

Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming out from the dust

In a blue light
In a green light
In a half light
In a work light

In a B-spin
Flip flopping
In a pulse wave
Outstepping

To put the shadows back into
The boxes

I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second

I have jettisoned my illusions
I have dislodged my depressions

I put the shadows back into
The boxes
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

The rats and children follow me out of town
The rats and children follow me out of town
Come on kids
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders and wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah-ah
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I cant read
Another message I cant read

Being the first in the Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
This beautiful world

I got a message I cant read, I got a message I cant read?
I got a message I cant read, I got a message I cant read
Another message I cant read
I got a message I cant read, I got a message I cant read
I got a message I cant read, I got a message I cant read
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case

After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking
Looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case 
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case

After years of waiting
You're a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin

And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down

I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will now mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling into the sea
Into the sea

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive

And there's be no more lies
There's be no more lies
There's be no more lies
There's be no more lies

I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
